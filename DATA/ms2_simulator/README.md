+ ``Known Structure-Known Spectrum (KS-KS)`` where the reported structure is confirmed by the experimental MS/MS spectrum;
+ ``Known Structure-Unknown Spectrum (KS-US)`` where the biologically examined (or partially expected) structures for which the spectrum is not validated by standard compounds; 
+ ``Unknown Structure-Known Spectrum (US-KS)`` where the mass spectrum itself is frequently monitored in biological samples but the structure is not elucidated or reported in life-science papers; 
+ ``Unknown Structure-Unknown Spectrum (US-US)`` where the putative dark matter of small molecules is unknown.
