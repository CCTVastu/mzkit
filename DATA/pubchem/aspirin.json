    "description": "Acetylsalicylic acid appears as odorless white crystals or crystalline powder with a slightly bitter taste. (NTP, 1992)\r\nAcetylsalicylic acid is a member of the class of benzoic acids that is salicylic acid in which the hydrogen that is attached to the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by an acetoxy group. A non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug with cyclooxygenase inhibitor activity. It has a role as a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, a non-narcotic analgesic, a platelet aggregation inhibitor, an antipyretic, a cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor, a cyclooxygenase 1 inhibitor, a prostaglandin antagonist, a teratogenic agent, an anticoagulant, a plant activator, an EC 1.1.1.188 (prostaglandin-F synthase) inhibitor, a drug allergen and a geroprotector. It is a member of benzoic acids, a member of salicylates and a member of phenyl acetates. It derives from a salicylic acid. It is a conjugate acid of an acetylsalicylate.\r\nAlso known as Aspirin, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) is a commonly used drug for the treatment of pain and fever due to various causes. Acetylsalicylic acid has both anti-inflammatory and antipyretic effects. This drug also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of blood clots stroke, and myocardial infarction (MI). Interestingly, the results of various studies have demonstrated that long-term use of acetylsalicylic acid may decrease the risk of various cancers, including colorectal, esophageal, breast, lung, prostate, liver and skin cancer. Aspirin is classified as a non-selective cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor and is available in many doses and forms, including chewable tablets, suppositories, extended release formulations, and others. Acetylsalicylic acid is a very common cause of accidental poisoning in young children. It should be kept out of reach from young children, toddlers, and infants.\r\nAspirin is a Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drug and Platelet Aggregation Inhibitor. The mechanism of action of aspirin is as a Cyclooxygenase Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of aspirin is by means of Decreased Prostaglandin Production and Decreased Platelet Aggregation.\r\nAspirin or acetylsalicylic acid is perhaps the most commonly used analgesic and antipyretic medication worldwide, having been in clinical use for over 100 years. Aspirin can cause several forms of liver injury: in high doses, aspirin can cause moderate to marked serum aminotransferase elevations occasionally with jaundice or signs of liver dysfunction, and in lower doses in susceptible children with a febrile illness aspirin can lead to Reye syndrome.\r\nAspirin is a natural product found in Ixora coccinea and Glycyrrhiza glabra with data available.\r\nAspirin is an orally administered non-steroidal antiinflammatory agent. Acetylsalicylic acid binds to and acetylates serine residues in cyclooxygenases, resulting in decreased synthesis of prostaglandin, platelet aggregation, and inflammation. This agent exhibits analgesic, antipyretic, and anticoagulant properties.\r\nAspirin is a metabolite found in the aging mouse brain.\r\nThe prototypical analgesic used in the treatment of mild to moderate pain. It has anti-inflammatory and antipyretic properties and acts as an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase which results in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of prostaglandins. Aspirin also inhibits platelet aggregation and is used in the prevention of arterial and venous thrombosis. (From Martindale, The Extra Pharmacopoeia, 30th ed, p5)",
