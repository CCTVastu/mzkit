In maize, benzoxazinoid biosynthesis branches off from tryptophan biosynthesis at indole-3-glycerol phosphate, which is converted to indole by indole-3-glycerol phosphate lyase, BX1. Subsequently four cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (BX2-BX5) catalyze the introduction of four oxygen atoms into the indole moiety, yielding DIBOA.

Sulfur occurs in various oxidation states ranging from +6 in sulfate to -2 in sulfide (H2S). Sulfate reduction can occur in both an energy consuming assimilatory pathway and an energy producing dissimilatory pathway. The assimilatory pathway, which is found in a wide range of organisms, produces reduced sulfur compounds for the biosynthesis of S-containing amino acids and does not lead to direct excretion of sulfide. In the dissimilatory pathway, which is restricted to obligatory anaerobic bacterial and archaeal lineages, sulfate (or sulfur) is the terminal electron acceptor of the respiratory chain producing large quantities of inorganic sulfide. Both pathways start from the activation of sulfate by reaction with ATP to form adenylyl sulfate (APS). In the assimilatory pathway [MD:M00176] APS is converted to 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate (PAPS) and then reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the assimilatory sulfite reductase. In the dissimilatory pathway [MD:M00596] APS is directly reduced to sulfite, and sulfite is further reduced to sulfide by the dissimilatory sulfite reductase. The capacity for oxidation of sulfur is quite widespread among bacteria and archaea, comprising phototrophs and chemolithoautotrophs. The SOX (sulfur-oxidation) system [MD:M00595] is a well-known sulfur oxidation pathway and is found in both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Green sulfur bacteria and purple sulfur bacteria carry out anoxygenic photosynthesis with reduced sulfur compounds such as sulfide and elemental sulfur, as well as thiosulfate (in some species with the SOX system), as the electron donor for photoautotrophic growth. In some chemolithoautotrophic sulfur oxidizers (such as Thiobacillus denitrificans), it has been suggested that dissimilatory sulfur reduction enzymes operate in the reverse direction, forming a sulfur oxidation pathway from sulfite to APS and then to sulfate."}, {"Q": 0.19290657439446432,"Input": 24,"Background": 137,"Activity": 0.03379385244866528,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.0010940523600228257,"less_pvalue": 0.9997130546915091,"greater_pvalue": 0.0006910074313877206,"matrix": [24, 137, 801, 10249],"hyper_state": {"n11": 24,"n1_": 161,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.0004040621228870989,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C00078", "C03470", "C07576", "C09131", "C11681", "C20410", "R00685", "R03738", "R04013", "R05847", "R05848", "R05866", "R05874", "R05881", "R05885", "R10128", "R10166", "R11935", "R11936", "R12104", "R12138", "R12142"],"Name": "Indole alkaloid biosynthesis","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.19135802469135826,"Input": 13,"Background": 74,"Activity": 0.03361695028361699,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.012034136432645512,"less_pvalue": 0.9957244954651683,"greater_pvalue": 0.01077413354285578,"matrix": [13, 74, 812, 10312],"hyper_state": {"n11": 13,"n1_": 87,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.006498629007927781,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C00448", "C17055", "C19867", "C19869", "R02305", "R07251", "R09758", "R09759", "R10988", "R11445", "R12137"],"Name": "Biosynthesis of various secondary metabolites - part 1","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.375,"Input": 14,"Background": 157,"Activity": 0.03343949044585987,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.6569891661266872,"less_pvalue": 0.723480298938624,"greater_pvalue": 0.3790261689601195,"matrix": [14, 157, 811, 10229],"hyper_state": {"n11": 14,"n1_": 171,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.10250646789907943,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C00079", "C01416", "C10860", "C12449", "R00692", "R00694", "R01153", "R06728", "R06731", "R06734", "R06744", "R08434"],"Name": "Tropane, piperidine and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.375,"Input": 7,"Background": 80,"Activity": 0.0328125,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.8352592554972288,"less_pvalue": 0.6908491636816046,"greater_pvalue": 0.4606400693296506,"matrix": [7, 80, 818, 10306],"hyper_state": {"n11": 7,"n1_": 87,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.1514892330108281,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00666", "C20279", "R02735", "R04390", "R07613", "R10013"],"Name": "Lysine biosynthesis","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.2333333333333338,"Input": 22,"Background": 158,"Activity": 0.032489451476793316,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.01984716681214699,"less_pvalue": 0.9934137589292762,"greater_pvalue": 0.012788981136398184,"matrix": [22, 158, 803, 10228],"hyper_state": {"n11": 22,"n1_": 180,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.006202740065696773,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00019", "C00051", "C00170", "C00440", "C04489", "C15650", "C15651", "R00178", "R00650", "R00900", "R00946", "R01113", "R01292", "R01401", "R01402", "R04405", "R04858", "R07393", "R07394", "R07395", "R08940", "R10404"],"Name": "Cysteine and methionine metabolism","Description": "Cysteine and methionine are sulfur-containing amino acids.

Methanotrophs consume methane as the only source of carbon, while methanogens produce methane as a metabolic byproduct. Methylotrophs, which are microorganisms that can obtain energy for growth by oxidizing one-carbon compounds, such as methanol and methane, are situated between methanotrophs and methanogens. Methanogens can obtain energy for growth by converting a limited number of substrates to methane under anaerobic conditions. Three types of methanogenic pathways are known: CO2 to methane [MD:M00567], methanol to methane [MD:M00356], and acetate to methane [MD:M00357]. Methanogens use 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (CoM; coenzyme M) as the terminal methyl carrier in methanogenesis and have four enzymes for CoM biosynthesis [MD:M00358]. Coenzyme B-Coenzyme M heterodisulfide reductase (Hdr), requiring for the final reaction steps of methanogenic pathway, is divided into two types: cytoplasmic HdrABC in most methanogens and membrane-bound HdrED in Methanosarcina species. In methanotrophs and methyltrophs methane is oxidized to form formaldehyde, which is at the diverging point for further oxidation to CO2 for energy source and assimilation for biosynthesis. There are three pathways that convert formaldehyde to C2 or C3 compounds: serine pathway [MD:M00346], ribulose monophosphate pathway [MD:M00345], and xylulose monophosphate pathway [MD:M00344]. The first two pathways are found in prokaryotes and the third is found in yeast.

Plants and cyanobacteria fix CO2 as organic compounds using solar energy mainly by the reductive pentose phosphate cycle (also called Calvin cycle, Calvin-Benson cycle, or Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle) [MD:M00165]. There are, at least, five additional carbon fixation pathways known to exist in autotrophic bacteria and archaea, which differ in reducing compounds, energy source, and oxygen sensitivity of enzymes. (i) The reductive citric acid cycle (Arnon-Buchanan cycle) [MD:M00173] is found in microaerophiles and anaerobes, such as green sulfur bacteria. In one complete turn of this cycle, four molecules of CO2 are fixed by the enzymes that are sensitive to oxygen, resulting in the production of one molecule of oxaloacetate, which is itself an intermediate of the cycle. (ii) The reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) [MD:M00377] is found in strictly anaerobic bacteria and archaea (Proteobacteria, Planctomycetes, Spirochaetes, and Euryarchaeota), some of which are methane-forming. A bifunctional enzyme, carbon monoxide dehydrogenase\/acetyl-CoA synthase, catalyzes the reactions from CO2 to CO and from CO2 to a methyl group, and then to generate acetyl-CoA. (iii) The 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle [MD:M00376] is found in some green non-sulphur bacteria of the family Chloroflexaceae. In one complete turn of this bicycle, three molecules of bicarbonate are converted into one molecule of pyruvate. In addition, this bicycle provides the secondary benefit of useful intermediates for biosynthesis: acetyl-CoA, glyoxylate, and succinyl-CoA. (iv) The hydroxypropionate-hydroxybutyrate cycle [MD:M00375] is found in aerobic Crenarchaeota, Acidianus, Metallosphaera, and Sulfolobales. Some of the intermediates and the carboxylation reactions are the same as in the 3-hydroxypropionate bicycle. One complete turn of this cycle generates two molecules of acetyl-CoA, one of which is reutilized in the the cycle and the other is removed for cell material biosynthesis. (v) The dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle [MD:M00374] was named after its intermediates: succinate (a kind of dicarboxylate) and hydroxybutyrate. This cycle has been found only in Ignicoccus hospitals, a strictly anaerobic hyperthermophilic archaea. Recent genome study suggests that this cycle may exist in Desulfurococcales (to which Ignicoccus belongs) and Thermoproteales (a taxon close to the origin of archaea).

Mammals cannot synthesize biotin, while in bacteria, fungi, and plants it is synthesized from pimelate thioester through different pathways. In E. coli and many organisms, pimelate thioester is derived from malonyl-ACP. The pathway starts with the methylation to malonyl-ACP methyl ester, followed by the fatty acid chain elongation cycle to form pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester, which is then demethylated to form pimeloyl-ACP [MD:M00572]. Pimeloyl-ACP is converted to biotin through the final four steps in the biotin bicyclic ring assembly, which are conserved among biotin-producing organisms [MD:M00123]. In B. subtilis, biotin is derived from pimeloyl-ACP formed by oxidative cleavage of long-chain acyl-ACPs [MD:M00573]. Some bacteria synthesize biotin from pimeloyl-CoA derived from pimelate [MD:M00577]. Biotin is covalently attached to biotin-dependent carboxylase by biotin protein ligase, also known as holocarboxylase synthase in mammals, to form an active holocarboxylase. After degradation of the biotinylated carboxylase into biocytin, it is further degraded by biotinidase to release free biotin, which is recycled in holocarboxylase synthesis. Biotin is catabolized by beta-oxidation of the valeric acid side chain or oxidation of sulfur in the heterocyclic ring."}, {"Q": 0.24999999999999992,"Input": 9,"Background": 128,"Activity":

The cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1 catalyzes conversion of cholesterol, a C27 compound, to the first C21 steroid, pregnenolone, which is converted by a bifunctional enzyme complex to the gestagen hormone, progesterone [MD:M00107]. Pregnenolone and progesterone are the starting materials for the three groups of steroids: C21 steroids of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, C19 steroids of androgens, and C18 steroids of estrogens. (i) Progesterone is converted by hydroxylations at carbons 21 and 11 to corticosterone, which is further modified by hydroxylation and oxydoreduction at carbon 18 to yield aldosterone, a mineralcorticoid [MD:M00108]. Cortisol, the main glucocorticoid, is formed from 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone with 11-deoxycortisol as an intermediate [MD:M00109]. (ii) Male hormone testosterone is formed from pregnenolone by two pathways, delta5 pathway via dehydroepiandrosterone and delta4 pathway via androstenedione [MD:M00110]. The enzyme CYP17A1 is responsible for the 17,20 lyase and 17alpha-hydroxylase activities in respective pathways. (iii) Female hormones estrone and estradiol are formed from testosterone and 4-androstene-3,17-dione by oxidative removal of the C19 methyl group and subsequent aromatization of ring A [MD:M00111]. In addition to these three groups, recent studies show that there is another group, termed neurosteroids, synthesized in the brain rather than the peripheral endocrine gland."}, {"Q": 0.13636363636363652,"Input": 14,"Background": 134,"Activity": 0.014246947082767995,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.3387354784157684,"less_pvalue": 0.8717885782543555,"greater_pvalue": 0.19993175525604412,"matrix": [14, 134, 811, 10252],"hyper_state": {"n11": 14,"n1_": 148,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.07172033350894114,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C09099", "R01942", "R06532", "R06533", "R06568", "R06610", "R06615", "R06820", "R08004", "R09791", "R12213", "R12264"],"Name": "Flavonoid biosynthesis","Description": "Flavonoids are a major class of plant secondary metabolites that serves a multitude of functions including pigments and antioxidant activity.

These and further modifications yield a variety of structural forms including chalcones, flavanones, dihyroflavonols, and flavans, anthocyanins, flavones and flavonols, and isoflavonoids."}, {"Q": 0.25,"Input": 12,"Background": 211,"Activity": 0.014218009478672985,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.29998413123539336,"less_pvalue": 0.15483875534897773,"greater_pvalue": 0.9031729797731751,"matrix": [12, 211, 813, 10175],"hyper_state": {"n11": 20,"n1_": 223,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.06274376698854721,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00234", "C00357", "C01674", "R02087", "R07660", "R08193", "R08555", "R08705", "R08710", "R08711", "R09942"],"Name": "Amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.5,"Input": 2,"Background": 71,"Activity": 0.014084507042253521,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.17386485200473914,"less_pvalue": 0.0875098091461357,"greater_pvalue": 0.9746738869147517,"matrix": [2, 71, 823, 10315],"hyper_state": {"n11": 8,"n1_": 73,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.08040547593873351,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C06731", "R05314"],"Name": "Xylene degradation","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.24305693314816773,"Input": 106,"Background": 1831,"Activity": 0.014071018521958372,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.00038935416809504576,"less_pvalue": 0.0001859744128331099,"greater_pvalue": 0.999874955777339,"matrix": [106, 1831, 719, 8555],"hyper_state": {"n11": 180,"n1_": 1937,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 8.199511572124571E-05,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C00051", "C00101", "C00440", "C00666", "C01101", "C01297", "C02798", "C02991", "C03925", "C05528", "C06103", "C06551", "C06598", "C06646", "C06731", "C07490", "C07725", "C11431", "C11536", "C12832", "C12835", "C13626", "C16206", "C16214", "C16247", "C16248", "C16403", "C16590", "C16597", "C18215", "C18261", "C18320", "C20199", "C20279", "R00943", "R01224", "R02289", "R02518", "R02735", "R03194", "R03244", "R03545", "R03772", "R04053", "R04109", "R05231", "R05244", "R05283", "R05314", "R05370", "R05400", "R05401", "R05402", "R05403", "R05474", "R05484", "R05544", "R05558", "R05656", "R05774", "R05789", "R05850", "R06832", "R06848", "R06882", "R07168", "R07514", "R07689", "R07690", "R07727", "R07783", "R07784", "R07785", "R07919", "R07920", "R08014", "R08015", "R08016", "R08019", "R08049", "R08214", "R09103", "R09138", "R09149", "R09177", "R09180", "R09235", "R09240", "R09241", "R09242", "R09243", "R09270", "R09271", "R09275", "R09280", "R09446", "R09471", "R10013", "R10136", "R10243", "R10397", "R10769", "R11929", "R12162"],"Name": "Microbial metabolism in diverse environments","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.10226946279803892,"Input": 72,"Background": 547,"Activity": 0.013461428375610242,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 9.302588392606339E-05,"less_pvalue": 0.9999672668223881,"greater_pvalue": 5.824826408662433E-05,"matrix": [72, 547, 753, 9839],"hyper_state": {"n11": 72,"n1_": 619,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 2.551508647401881E-05,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "C00101", "C00415", "C00669", "C01134", "C03263", "C05528", "C05924", "C11437", "C11536", "C16597", "C17010", "C18911", "C20246", "R00497", "R00936", "R00937", "R00939", "R00940", "R00942", "R00943", "R01078", "R02235", "R02236", "R03035", "R03194", "R03220", "R03231", "R03472", "R03948", "R04109", "R04178", "R04994", "R05149", "R05180", "R05181", "R05774", "R05789", "R05808", "R05810", "R05838", "R06895", "R07236", "R07501", "R07504", "R07773", "R07774", "R07775", "R08214", "R08588", "R08769", "R08771", "R09376", "R09379", "R09394", "R09520", "R09543", "R09726", "R09736", "R09737", "R09977", "R10116", "R10118", "R10120", "R10122", "R10246", "R10247", "R10709", "R11061", "R11580", "R12162"],"Name": "Biosynthesis of cofactors","Description": ""}, {"Q": 0.19999999999999996,"Input": 7,"Background": 105,"Activity": 0.01333333333333333,"Fisher": {"two_tail_pvalue": 0.8550108884582218,"less_pvalue": 0.41246583216741195,"greater_pvalue": 0.7263888000006542,"matrix": [7, 105, 818, 10281],"hyper_state": {"n11": 8,"n1_": 112,"n_1": 825,"n": 11211,"prob": 0.14498911151498972,"valid": true}},"Hits": ["C00005", "C00019", "R03554", "R05834", "R06417", "R06419", "R06420"],"Name": "Monoterpenoid biosynthesis","Description": "Monoterpenoids (C10 terpenoids) are a group of terpenoids consisting of two isoprene units.

The core nitrogen cycle involves four reduction pathways and two oxidation pathways. Nitrogen fixation [MD:M00175] is the process of reducing atmospheric molecular nitrogen to ammonia, a biologically useful reduced form incorporated into amino acids and other vital compounds. The ability of fixing atmospheric nitrogen by the nitrogenase enzyme complex is present in restricted prokaryotes (diazotrophs). The other reduction pathways are assimilatory nitrate reduction [MD:M00531] and dissimilatory nitrate reduction [MD:M00530] both for conversion to ammonia, and denitrification [MD:M00529]. Denitrification is a respiration in which nitrate or nitrite is reduced as a terminal electron acceptor under low oxygen or anoxic conditions, producing gaseous nitrogen compounds (N2, NO and N2O) to the atmosphere. The two oxidation pathways are nitrification [MD:M00528] and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox). Nitrification is the oxidation of ammonia (NH3) with oxygen into nitrite followed by the oxidation of nitrite into nitrate. The first step is performed by ammonia-oxidizing microorganisms (e.g., Nitrosomonas and Nitrosococcus) and the second step by nitrite-oxidizing microorganisms (e.g., Nitrobacter). Anammox is a biochemical process of oxidizing ammonium (NH4+) into dinitrogen gas (N2) using nitrite as an electron acceptor.
