Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on \u201cultrafast\u201d experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism.<\/p>NMR Calibration Standard corresponding to the MTBLS132 datasets.","Sample collection: Reference standards were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and prepared in-house.","Extraction: The particularity of 2D NMR for quantitative analysis is that the peak volumes depend on several factors in addition to the concentration. Building a calibration curve for each targeted metabolite is therefore indispensable\u2014still, a single series of calibration samples containing all the targeted metabolites together is sufficient, and better reflects the complexity of the extracts. For this purpose, five calibration samples containing eight targeted metabolites at different concentrations were prepared in the phosphate buffer solution used to prepare the fruit extracts. The values of these concentrations (see Supplementary Table S2 in the paper associated with this study) were determined from previous profiling studies performed on tomato pericarp [1][2]. To keep a similar ionic force across the calibration range, the changes in the concentrations of these eight metabolites were not uniform. As with the fruit extracts reported in MTBLS131 and MTBLS132, the calibration samples were also titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h. Ref: [1] Deborde, C., Maucourt, M., Baldet, P., Bernillon, S., Biais, B., Talon, G., et al. (2009).

All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 5 ppm (F2) x 5.4 ppm (F1) at 700 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS\u2022N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 700 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 16 and N1 = 4. Due to high magnetic field, interleaving was required to sample the same spectral width as on a 500 MHz spectrometer. The experiment duration was kept constant by reducing the number of scans thanks to the highest sensitivity of the 700 MHz spectrometer. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G\/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G\/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G\/cm and 256 \u00b5s. The amplitude and duration of the pre-acquisition gradient were adapted to center the chemical shift range of interest in the middle of the detection window in the spatially encoded dimension.

PMID:24322368 ","Data transformation: Before Fourier Transformation, 2D FIDs were weighed with apodization functions leading to the optimum sensitivity for the relevant peaks. A sinebell function was applied in the conventional dimension of all the experiments. In the ultrafast dimension, an apodization was performed in the spatial dimension with optimized gaussian apodization functions designed according to a recently described procedure [1]. The conventional spectra were zero-filled in both dimensions and the ultrafast spectra were zero-filled in the conventional dimension. All the spectra were processed in the magnitude mode. Finally, a second order automatic baseline correction was applied in the two dimensions of the 2D spectra.The specific processing for the ultrafast spectra (as described in [2]) was performed using a home-written routine in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany.

PMID:15369377 ","Metabolite id: Eight major polar compounds of tomato flesh, belonging to several metabolite families and implicated in fruit growth and quality, were selected for quantification. After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples. To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a\u2022[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample. To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite.

We previously showed differences in mucus gut microbiota composition preceded colitis-induced inflammation and stool microbial differences only became apparent at colitis onset. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether microbial dysbiosis was associated with differences in both predicted microbial gene content and endogenous metabolite profiles. We examined the functional potential of mucus and stool microbial communities in the mdr1a -\/- mouse model of colitis and littermate controls using PICRUSt on 16S rRNA sequencing data. Our findings indicate that despite changes in microbial composition, microbial functional pathways were stable before and during the development of mucosal inflammation. LC-MS-based metabolic phenotyping (metabotyping) in urine samples confirmed that metabolite profiles in mdr1a -\/- mice were remarkably unaffected by development of intestinal inflammation and there were no differences in previously published metabolic markers of IBD. Metabolic profiles did, however, discriminate the colitis-prone mdr1a -\/- genotype from controls. Our results indicate resilience of the metabolic network irrespective of inflammation.

The study of assembling phototrophic biofilm communities provides a robust means to identify such interactions and evaluate their contributions to the recruitment and maintenance of phylogenetic and functional diversity overtime. To examine primary succession in phototrophic communities, we isolated two unicyanobacterial consortia from the microbial mat in HotLake, Washington, characterizing the membership and metabolic function of each consortium. We then analyzed the spatial structures and quantified the community compositions of their assembling biofilms. The consortia retained the same suite of heterotrophic species, identified as abundant members of the mat and assigned to Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Autotroph growth rates dominated early in assembly, yielding to increasing heterotroph growth rates late in succession. The two consortia exhibited similar assembly patterns, with increasing relative abundances of members from Bacteroidetes and Alphaproteobacteria concurrent with decreasing relative abundances of those from Gamma proteobacteria. Despite these similarities at higher taxonomic levels, the relative abundances of individual heterotrophic species were substantially different in the developing consortial biofilms. This suggests that, although similar niches are created by the cyanobacterial metabolisms, the resulting webs of autotroph-heterotroph and heterotroph-heterotroph interactions are specific to each primary producer. The relative simplicity and tractability of the Hot Lake unicyanobacterial consortia make them useful model systems for deciphering interspecies interactions and assembly principles relevant to natural microbial communities.","Sample collection: Enrichment cultures were generated by subdividing the mat lamina and streaking a subsample of the green layer onto BG-11 plates [1] buffered with 10 mM TES pH 8.0 and amended with 400 mM MgSO4, 80 mM Na2SO4, 20 mM KCl, 1 mM NaHCO3, here after referred to as Hot Lake autotroph (HLA) medium. HLA was amended with 1 x Wolfe's vitamins [2] for initial isolation. Solid medium was generated through the addition of 10 g\/l triple-washed agar (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Unless noted, all chemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO. Plates were incubated at room temperature (~23 \u00b0C) under a fluorescent grow light (General Electric PL\/AQ, Fairfield, CT) with a continuous photon flux of 20 \u00b5E\/m^2\/s. No exogenous sources of organic carbon were added. Two morphologically distinct cyanobacteria that grew on the plate were resuspended in HLA broth and physically isolated with a micropipette under a dissecting microscope. Each filament, including its co-isolated heterotrophs, was inoculated into sterile HLA broth and cultivated, yielding two unicyanobacterial consortia, UCC-A and UCC-O. The consortia were there after maintained continuously, with passaging performed every 4 weeks at a dilution of 1:100 into 100 ml of HLA broth in 250 ml borosilicate-glass Erlenmeyer flasks under the cultivation conditions described above. The enrichment cultures were physically homogenized prior to subculturing by dividing the cultures into sterile 50 ml conical vials with sterile 3mm glass beads and vigorously shaking the tubes by hand for ~15 s to disrupt the biofilms. Heterotrophs were isolated from the Hot Lake mat or enrichment cultures by streaking a portion of a homogenized sample onto HLA plates supplemented with 0.25% yeast extract and 5m MNH4Cl, henceforth referred to as Hot Lake Heterotroph (HLH) medium, and incubating at room temperature in the dark.

Dry biomass weight was recorded prior to resuspension with 200 \u00b5l of nanopure water to which was added a half volume of 0.1 mm zirconium\/silica beads (Biospec, Bartlesville,OK). The biomass was homogenized by vortexing for 2 min, and metabolites were extracted with 800 \u00b5l of chloroform\/methanol mixture (2:1,v\/v). After centrifugation (15,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C, 5min) the aqueous layer was transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo. Polar metabolites from microbial mat collected -80 \u00b0C were extracted using the same procedure. A mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs; C8-C28) dissolved in hexane was used as a retention index standard.","Chromatography: Polar metabolite analysis was performed with an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). For untargeted analysis of polar metabolites, dried aqueous layers were chemically derivatized as previously described [1][2] and analyzed in duplicate. Samples were analyzed according to the method used to create the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library [3]. An HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.2 5mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used. The sample injection mode was splitless, and 1 \u00b5l of each sample was injected. The injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 \u00b0C [2]. The helium gas flow rate was determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies) and was in the range of 0.45-0.5 ml\/min. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m\/z. The mixture of FAMEs(C8 - C28) was analyzed one per day alongside the samples to standardize retention index alignment in subsequent data analysis. Ref: [1] Kim Y.-M., Metz T. O., Hu Z., Wiedner S.

Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m\/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.","Data transformation: GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the Metabolite Detector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution.","Metabolite id: Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m\/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance.

To detect and identify metabolites that may be products of pathways important in contributing to resistance against H. fraxineus we performed untargeted metabolomic profiling on leaves from selected F. excelsior individuals showing strong tolerance or susceptibility to H. fraxineus. We identified sets of \u201cfeatures\u201d [small molecules] that enabled strong discrimination between tolerant or susceptible genotypes of F. excelsior. Strikingly, tolerant F. excelsior lines exhibited low levels of iridoid glycosides, known anti-feeding deterrents. As Europe is threatened by Emerald Ash Borer (Agrilus planipennis), an invasive wood boring beetle native to East Asia that has devastated North American ash, our study raises the question whether selection for resistance to H. fraxineus leads to ecological trade-offs that result in susceptibility to emerging pests such as emerald ash borer.","Sample collection: Scions were collected from the 15 trees in either Randers or Taps\u00f8re during January and February 2013, grafted onto rootstocks of F. excelsior seedlings, potted and placed in a greenhouse at the University of Copenhagen. Leaves were sampled in two batches: #-Taps trees (except 25Utaps) were sampled in May 2014 while R- trees (plus 25UTaps) were sampled in September 2014. All plants were symptom free at the time of sampling. Three leaves were sampled from each graft, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C.","Extraction: Three leaflets from each triplicate sample were freeze dried and gently crushed. Approximately 100 mg was ground to a fine powder using a TissueLyser (Qiagen), and 10 mg was extracted in 400 ul 80% MeOH containing d5-IAA internal standard at 2.5 ng\/ml, centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min) and the pellet re-extracted in 80% MeOH. The pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m syringe filter (Phenomenex, UK).","Chromatography: These leaf extracts (5 \u00b5l) were analysed using a Polaris C18 1.8 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 250 mm reverse phase analytical column (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA) and samples resolved on an Agilent 1200 series Rapid Resolution HPLC system coupled to a QToF 6520 mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, USA).

The source conditions for electrospray ionisation were as follows: gas temperature was 325 \u00b0C with a drying gas flow rate of 9 l\/min and a nebuliser pressure of 35 psig. The capillary voltage was 3.5 kV in both positive and negative ion mode. The fragmentor voltage was 115 V and skimmer 70 V.

Peak identification and alignment was performed using the Bioconductor R package, xcms [1]. Using xcms, features were detected using the centWave method for high resolution LC\/MS data in centroid mode at 30 ppm. Changes to the default parameters were: mzdiff=0.01, peakwidth=10-80, noise=1000, prefilter=3,500. Peaks were matched across samples using the density method with a bw=5 and mzwid=0.025 and retention time correlated using the obiwarp algorithm with profStep=0.5. Missing peak data was filled in the peaklists generated from the ADB tolerant ash leaf samples compared to the peaklists generated from the ADB susceptible leaves. The resulting peaklists were annotated using the Bioconductor R package, CAMERA [2]. The peaks were grouped using 0.05% of the width of the full width at half maximum (FWHM) and groups correlated using a p-value of 0.05 and calculating correlation inside and across samples. Isotopes and adducts were annotated using a 10 ppm error. Statistical analysis and modelling was performed using MetaboAnalyst v3.0 [3] with the following parameters. Features with 50% or more missing values were automatically removed and replaced using a missing value estimation corresponding to half of the minimum positive value in the original data. Data was filtered (40%) to remove non-informative variables using the interquartile range (IQR). Samples were normalised using the internal standard d5-IAA (POS: M181T1448; NEG: M179T1382).

A key step in the preparation of samples for GC-MS is derivatisation, in particular, methoximation and trimethylsilylation. This paper presents an assessment of automated derivatisation protocols for GC-MS-based untargeted metabolomic analysis of rat urine. Automated batch and in-time (a sample ready for injection every 70 minutes) derivatisation protocols were tested using BSTFA and MSTFA. Principal component analysis determined differences based upon protocol tested (PC-1; 19%) and silylation reagent (PC-2; 17%) used. Of 249 compounds, 40 compounds were significantly different (P<0.05) based upon reagent and 154 compounds were significantly different (P<0.05) based upon protocol. A key outcome of this study was the demonstrated effects of derivatisation including reagent and protocol (i.e. reaction duration, temperature and mixing speed) on individual urinary metabolites. It is hoped that the current work will provide a reference on which to base future GC-MS-based untargeted and targeted metabolomic analyses of urine.","Sample collection: Female Lewis (LEW\/CrlBR) rat urine (4-5 ml spot; pooled) was collected at and purchased from the Animal Resources Centre (ARC; Perth, WA, Australia). Sample collection was conducted in accordance with the Australian Code of Practice for the Care and Use of Animals for Scientific Purposes (7th Edition, 2004). The sample was collected into a 10 ml plastic graduated centrifuge tube at room temperature and then frozen at -20 \u00b0C at the ARC. The sample was transported on dry ice on the same day as collection and then stored at -80 \u00b0C for approximately one month (38 days) until processing.","Extraction: Urine (50 \u00b5l) was treated with 50 \u00b5l of a urease solution (1 U\/\u00b5l) as optimised by Abbiss et al.[1]. Samples were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C and then centrifuged for 10 min at 1,500 \u00d7 g. Chilled (approx. -20 \u00b0C) methanol containing uniformly labelled 13C,15N-valine and 13C-sorbitol as internal standards (200 \u00b5l; 29.25 \u00b5g\/ml) was added to the sample. Samples were agitated for 10 min at 1,200 rpm and subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and 13,400 \u00d7 g. Aliquots (50 \u00b5l) of the sample were transferred to 200 \u00b5l glass inserts (for 2 ml GC vials) and dried in an Eppendorf Concentrator Plus rotary vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf South Pacific Pty. Ltd., North Ryde, NSW, Australia). The dried extract was stored at -80 \u00b0C for approximately 2 weeks (15 days) until derivatization and analysis. For the control protocol, metabolites were treated with 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine-HCl (20 mg\/ml in pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 1,200 rpm and 30 \u00b0C in an Eppendorf Thermomixer Comfort. Following this, 40 \u00b5l of BSTFA or MSTFA was added and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min at 300 rpm in the thermomixer. 5 \u00b5l of an alkane mix (C10, C12, C15, C19, C22, C28; 0.156 mg\/ml; C32, C36; 0.313 mg\/ml) in hexane was added to the final sample for the calculation of a Kovat\u2019s Retention Index for each compound. For automated protocols (batch and in-time), reagents (methoxyamine-HCl, BSTFA or MSTFA, n-alkanes) were added using a CTC CombiPAL autosampler (CTC Analytics, Zwingen, Switzerland) with an agitator and equipped with a gas tight, cone tip 25 \u00b5l syringe (SGE, Ringwood, Victoria, Australia). Automated procedures were kept the same as the control with the exception that 500 rpm (maximum setting) was used for both automated procedures and a temperature of 37 \u00b0C for both methoximation and trimethylsilylation was used for the automated in-time protocol as there was only one agitator. The automated batch protocol prepared a batch of samples and the automated in-time procedure used a staggered approach resulting in a sample being ready for immediate injection every 70 min.

The GC was equipped with an Agilent 7683 series auto-injector. The auto-injector and GC were controlled by MSD Chemstation v D.01.02.16. The column used was an Agilent VF-5ms (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm ID \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m DF + 10 m EZ-Guard; Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA). The derivatized sample (1 \u00b5l) was injected in splitless mode into the inlet at a temperature of 230 \u00b0C. The syringe was rinsed with methanol three times before each injection and ten times after each injection. The initial column temperature was set to 70 \u00b0C. A temperature ramp of 1 \u00b0C\/min for 5 minutes followed by a temperature ramp of 5.63 \u00b0C\/min to a final temperature of 330 \u00b0C with a hold time of 10 minutes.

The carrier gas used was helium at a flow rate of 1 ml\/min (constant flow mode).","Mass spec: An Agilent 5973N mass selective detector (Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used. The transfer line was set to 330 \u00b0C and the ion source was set to 200 \u00b0C. Ionisation was achieved with a 70 eV electron beam and the quadrupole mass analyzer was operated in full scan mode over the range m\/z 45-600 with a scan rate of approximately 3 scans per second. The MS was calibrated and auto-tuned using PFTBA. The reproducibility (RSD) of internal standards was in the range 6-29% for all except one method which was 68%.","Data transformation: Full scan data was processed using AnalyzerPro\u2122 v2.7 (SpectralWorks, Runcorn, UK). The Ruby scripting program was used to align common chromatographic peaks as described in Gummer et al.[1]. Following this, manual alignment of data was required to align peaks of the same compound which had deconvoluted differently in different samples. Peaks which occurred in <10% of the samples were removed from subsequent analyses. Unless otherwise stated, peak area (x) was log transformed using the equation x=log10(x+1) for further analysis. Principal component analysis was conducted using The Unscrambler X v10.1 (CAMO, Oslo, Norway). All metabolites were assessed for statistical significance using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS v22). Where data were normally distributed (determined by Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) and variance was homogenous (determined by Levene\u2019s test), two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of reagent and protocol on 1) number of deconvoluted peaks; and 2) total ion chromatogram (TIC) area. A one-way ANOVA was used to determine the effects of 1) reagent and 2) protocol on metabolite peak area. Where data were non-normal and\/or variance was heterogeneous the Mann-Whitney U-test or Kruskal-Wallis test were used. Main effects were analysed using Bonferroni post hoc correction for multiple comparisons. Spearman\u2019s correlation coefficient was employed to determine significant correlations between the internal standard and total ion chromatogram area where appropriate. A 0.05 criterion of statistical significance and 95% confidence interval were employed for all tests. Ref: [1] Gummer JP, Trengove RD, Oliver RP, Solomon PS.

Putative identifications were made by comparing mass spectra with a user-generated library of metabolite standards (Metabolomics Australia, Murdoch University Node) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 2011 MS Search v2.0 library. Where compounds were identified using only the NIST library, identifications were made with confidence scores >70% and probability scores >20% (>70% of IDs were made with probability scores >50%). Identifications were made for all compounds where possible and assigned an identification level as per Sumner et al.[1] and score as per Sumner et al.[2]. A revised score has been proposed to include a score for a match to an authentic standard (+1.5) and compound class match (+0.5).

This study aimed to compare untargeted volatile compound profiles from SPME-GCxGC-TOF-MS and sensory analysis data of Sauvignon blanc wine inoculated with six different non-Saccharomyces yeasts followed by SC. Torulaspora delbrueckii (TD), Lachancea thermotolerans (LT), Pichia kluyveri (PK) and Metschnikowia pulcherrima (MP) where commercial starter strains, while Candida zemplinina (CZ) and Kazachstania aerobia (KA), were isolated from wine grape environments. Each fermentation produced a distinct profile both sensorially and chemically. SC and CZ were the most distinct in both of these cases. SC had guava, grapefruit, banana, and pineapple aromas while CZ was driven by fermented apple, dried peach\/apricot, and stewed fruit as well as sour flavor. Chemically over 300 unique features were identified as significantly different across the fermentations. SC had the highest number of esters in the highest relative concentration but all the yeasts had distinct ester profiles. CZ displayed the highest number of terpenes in high concentration but also produced a large amount of acetic acid. KA was high in ethyl acetate. TD had fewer esters but three distinctly higher thiol compounds. LT showed a relatively high number of increased acetate esters and certain terpenes. PK had some off odor compounds while the MP had high levels of different methyl butyl-, methyl propyl-, and phenethyl esters. Overall, this study gives a more detailed profile of these yeasts than anything previously reported.","Sample collection: Sauvignon blanc grapes (vintage 2014) were obtained from the vineyards at Welgevallen Experimental Farm, Stellenbosch University, Stellenbosch, South Africa. S. cerevisiae (Enoferm M2\u00ae, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), T. delbrueckii (Biodiva\u00ae, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), M. pulcherrima (Flavia\u00ae, Lallemand Inc., Quebec, Canada), P. kluyveri (Viniflora\u00ae FROOTZEN\u2122, Chr. Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark), L. thermotolerans (Viniflora\u00ae CONCERTO\u2122, Chr. Hansen, Horsholm, Denmark), C. zemplinina (Institute of Wine Biotechnology (IWBT)-Y1082) and K. aerobia (IWBT-Y845) were used to ferment the grape must. 11 l stainless steel fermentation vessels containing 10 l of must were inoculated with 10^6 cfu\/ml of yeast. Fermentations were carried out in triplicate at 15 \u00b0C. The non-Saccharomyces yeasts were allowed to ferment until approximately 2% ethanol concentration was reached. At this point, S. cerevisiae was added at 10^6 cfu\/mL concentration to finish the fermentations. The final wines were bottled after clarification via cold rest for one week at -4 \u00b0C in 750 ml glass bottles with screw caps. Wines were then transported to the laboratory of the Department of Food Quality and Nutrition, Research and Innovation Center, Fondazione Edmund Mach (FEM) for chemical analysis.","Extraction: A divinylbenzene\/carboxen\/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB\/CAR\/PDMS) coating 50\/30 \u03bcm, 2 cm length Solid-Phase-Micro-Extraction (SPME) fibre was used for wine volatile extraction. Vials were prepared as follows. 5 ml of wine and 50 \u03bcl of 0.5 mg\/l 2-octanol were added to 20 ml screw cap vials containing 1.5 g NaCl. A Gerstel MPS autosampler (GERSTEL GmbH & Co. KG) equipped with the standard sample agitator and a SPME fibre conditioning station was used to extract the volatiles from the sample vial headspace. The samples were incubated for 5 min at 35 \u00b0C under 500 rpm rotation at 10 s intervals. Extraction took place at 10 s, 5 min, and 30 min, prior to desorption in the inlet for 180 s at 250 \u00b0C. Quality control (QC) vials consisting of an equal mix of all samples were spaced at the beginning and every third sample thereafter.","Chromatography: GC\u00d7GC-TOF-MS analysis of the extracts was performed using a LECO Pegasus-4D system consisting of an Agilent 6890N (Agilent Technologies) coupled to a LECO Pegasus 4D detector. The system employed a consumables free modulation system. Helium carrier gas was used with a flow set at 1.2 mL\/min and a splitless time of 180sec. The oven was equipped with a 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u03bcm VF-WAX MS primary column (Agilent Technologies) and a 1.5 m x 0.15 mm x 0.15 \u03bcm RXI 17Sil MS secondary column (Restek Corporation, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The GC oven parameters were as follows: initial temperature was 40 \u00b0C held for 2 min, followed by an increase to 250 \u00b0C at a rate of 6 \u00b0C\/min, the oven was then held at 250 \u00b0C for 5 min before returning to the initial temperature (40 \u00b0C). The total cycle time, was 42 min. The modulation period was set to 7 s with a hot pulse time of 1.4 s. The modulator was offset by 15 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: The MS protocol consisted of electron ionization at 70 eV with ion source temperature at 230 \u00b0C, a detector voltage of 1543 V with a voltage offset of 200 V, mass range of m\/z 35-350, and acquisition rate of 200 spectra per second. There was an acquisition delay of 120 s.","Data transformation: ChromaTOF software version 4.32 was used to perform baseline correction, deconvolution and peak picking of the raw data. The baseline offset was set to 1, just above the noise level. The first dimension peak width was set to 43 s while the second dimension peak width was set to 0.1 s. A factor of 500 was set as the match required to combine peaks in the second dimension. A signal to noise (S\/N) of 10 was used for the 10 s and 5 min extraction times data with a minimum S\/N of 6 for sub peak retention. A S\/N of 100 was used for the 30 min extraction time data with a minimum S\/N of 60 for sub peak retention. Traditional integration was used. Forward library searching was used with the following parameters: Hits to return were set to 10, minimum molecular weight was set to 40, maximum molecular weight was set to 350, the mass threshold was set to 50 and the minimum similarity match was set to 700. The NIST and Wiley libraries were used. For alignment the following parameters were used: a mass threshold of 10, a minimum similarity match of 600, the maximum number of modulation periods matching peaks could be apart was set to 1, a maximum retention time difference was set to 7 s, for peaks not found by initial peak finding the signal to noise ratio was set to 5 for the 10 s and 5 min extractions and to 50 for the 30 min extractions, for analytes to be kept they had to be found in all biological replicates within a class. Each yeast species was given its own class.","Metabolite id: Metabolite identification was preformed using spectral matching to the NIST and Wiley libraries. In the retention time column we report both the first and second dimention time separated by a comma (eg. 1D, 2D)."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS212","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS212","title":"Untangling the wine metabolome

isotope labeling data provide crucial information about the operation of metabolic pathways, and are commonly generated via liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Metabolome-wide analysis is challenging as it requires grouping of metabolite features over different samples. We developed DynaMet for fully automated investigations of isotope labeling experiments from LC-high resolution MS raw data. DynaMet enables untargeted extraction of metabolite labeling profiles and provides integrated tools for expressive data visualization. For this study we generated labeling data of the model strain Bacillus methanolicus from 13C methanol resulting in complex spectra in multi carbon compounds. Analysis of two biological replicates revealed high robustness and reproducibility of the pipeline. In total, DynaMet extracted 386 features showing dynamic labeling within ten minutes. Of these features, 357 could be fitted by implemented kinetic models. Feature identification against KEGG database resulted in 247 matches covering multiple pathways of core metabolism and major biosynthetic routes. The study results reported here are only a summary. To reproduce the complete results including plots, DynaMet software is required.","Sample collection: B. Methanolicus MGA3 cells were sampled at OD600 between 1 and 1.5. To perform 13C labeling , 0.5 ml of B. methanolicus MGA3 culture grown in bioreactors with naturally labeled methanol was transferred into 50 ml Falcon tubes containing 4.5 ml of temperature adjusted (50 \u00b0C) MSV medium with 0.5 M 99% 13C methanol. Samples in tubes were continuously mixed and incubated for 5 s, 10 s, 20 s, 30 s, 60 s, 120 s, 300 s, and 600 s at the respective temperatures before the entire 5 ml was transferred onto a 0.2 \u00b5m polyethylensulfon (PESU) filter (Sartorius Stedium). Cells were vacuum filtered and immediately washed with 10 ml warm MilliQ water (20 \u00b0C) to remove culture medium.","Extraction: For quenching and metabolite extraction, filters with cells were transferred into 8 ml quenching solution (mixture of acetonitrile, methanol and 0.5 M formic acid at a 60:20:20 ratio) at -20 \u00b0C, incubated for 10 minutes on ice and sonified 3 times for 10 s based on a protocol adapted from [1]. Samples were snap frozen in liquid N2, lyophilized and stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. Prior to analysis, samples were resuspended with MilliQ water to a final biomass concentration of 1 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l.

An overview of all processing steps is shown in the file 'Data Transformation Protocol.txt' which is available in the study folder.","Metabolite id: Metabolite identification was performed using identification module of Dynamet software. To match features to data base, monoisotopic masses of features are calculated from possible adducts mass shifts. In case of successful adduct grouping the assigned monoisotopic mass is used to search for masses in database within user defined maximal deviation whereby matches are further restricted by estimation of metabolites possible number of carbon atoms. We estimated the number of carbon atoms from mass isotopologue pattern of natural labeled, and if provided, from a mixture of natural labeled and uniformly 13C labeled cell extract. As a general restriction the range of the possible number of carbon atoms is calculated for each metabolite, whereby the lower limit is defined by the number of 13C related mass isotopologues grouped per feature and the upper limit by the compound with similar mass present in the Pubchem database containing most number of carbon atoms. Depending on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained by applied estimation methods, each estimation gets a quality score (q-score) ranging from 0 to 15, and best scored estimation is selected. For the current study the KEGG database was used.

Typhimurium) is a facultative pathogen that uses complex mechanisms to invade and proliferate within mammalian host cells. To investigate possible contributions of metabolic processes to virulence in S. Typhimurium grown under conditions known to induce expression of virulence genes, we used a metabolomics-driven systems biology approach coupled with genome scale modeling. First, we identified distinct metabolite profiles associated with bacteria grown in either rich or virulence-inducing media and report the most comprehensive coverage of the S. Typhimurium metabolome to date. Second, we applied an omics-informed genome scale modeling analysis of the functional consequences of adaptive alterations in S. Typhimurium metabolism during growth under our conditions. Modeling efforts highlighted a decreased cellular capability to both produce and utilize intracellular amino acids during stationary phase culture in virulence conditions, despite significant abundance increases for these molecules as observed by our metabolomics measurements. Furthermore, analyses of omics data in the context of the metabolic model indicated rewiring of the metabolic network to support pathways associated with virulence. For example, cellular concentrations of polyamines were perturbed, as well as the predicted capacity for secretion and uptake.","Sample collection: S. Typhimurium wild type cells (ATCC 14028) were used throughout this study and were taken from a single colony on an agar plate, subsequently inoculated into 7 ml of Luria-Bertani (LB) media (comprised of 1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% sodium chloride at pH 7), and incubated overnight at 37 \u00b0C. The overnight culture was centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The cell pellets were suspended in LB media and centrifuged again, and the supernatant was discarded. For LB cultures, the cell pellets were subsequently suspended in 2 ml of LB media and used to inoculate 700 ml of LB in a 2.8 l flask. After 160 min of growth, cells were harvested via centrifugation (4,000 x g) and washed twice with Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (Mediatech) once cultures reached an OD600 of +1.0. To stimulate the Salmonella virulence program, cells were transferred to a low pH, low magnesium, and low iron (LPM) medium comprised of 8 \u00b5M MgCL2, 0.5 \u00b5M ferric citrate, 5 mM KCl, 7.5 mM NH4SO4, 0.5 mM K2SO4, 0.3% glycerol v\/v, 0.00001% thiamine, 337 \u00b5M H3PO4, and 80 mM 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid at pH 5.8. Briefly, cell pellets from the 7 ml LB media were suspended in LPM media and centrifuged. The supernatant was discarded and cell pellets were suspended in 2 ml of LPM media and used to inoculate 700 ml of LPM in a 2.8 l flask. Cells were harvested after 4 h or 20 h, then washed and isolated as above. Three biological replicates were performed for each of the conditions described above.","Extraction: Cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to thawing and were subsequently resuspended in an appropriate volume of 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate according to their wet weight to compensate for any differences in cell numbers. The cells were lysed by bead-beating, and the lysates were transferred into new tubes. Subsequently, 100 \u00b5l aliquots of cell lysates were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20 \u00b0C) chloroform\/methanol (2:1, v\/v), and the aqueous phases after centrifugation were transferred to glass vials and dried in vacuo (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All samples were kept at -80 \u00b0C prior to chemical derivatization for GC-MS analysis. Chemical derivatization: Dried metabolite extracts were briefly dried again to remove any residual water prior to chemical derivatization. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg\/ml) were added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with generous shaking for 90 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 \u00b5L of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were then analyzed by GC-MS in random order. For technical replicates, each of the derivatized samples was split into two different vials and analyzed separately.","Chromatography: Chromatography was carried out on an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (Chemstation) and a HP-5MS gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA; 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness).","Mass spec: Samples were analyzed in duplicate using an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) using a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies). One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 250 \u00b0C throughout analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60\u00b0C for 1 min and then ramped to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min and kept at this final temperature for 5 min to complete an analysis cycle. Derivatized metabolites eluting from the GC column were ionized using electron ionization (70 eV), and data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m\/z.","Data transformation: After converting raw data to netCDF format, the data were processed by the MetaboliteDetector software for peak deconvolution and chromatographic alignment. Retention indices (RI) were calculated based on the analysis of a mixture of fatty acid methyl esters (C8 - C30) (Agilent Technologies) as external retention time standards, then their retention index information was subsequently applied to all experimental chromatograms for retention time alignment. MetaboliteDetector parameters for peak detection and deconvolution are as follows: Peak threshold, 7; minimum peak height, 7; deconvolution width, 8.","Metabolite id: Deconvoluted features were identified by matching to the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked Library, which contains mass spectral and retention index information for approximately 700 metabolites. Each initial match to the library was manually inspected to confirm a confident identification. MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification\/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; deltaRI, 25; minimum S\/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses. All identifications were manually validated by inspection of retention index and spectrum matches."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS35","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS35","title":"Salmonella Modulates Metabolism during Growth under Conditions that Induce Expression of Virulence Genes","date":"2013-05-02","timestamp":1367449200,"submitter":["Thomas Metz","Charles Ansong","Joshua Adkins"],"publications":[{"title":"Salmonella Modulates Metabolism during Growth under Conditions that Induce Expression of Virulence Genes","doi":"10.1039\/c3mb25598k","pubmed":"PMID:23559334"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"5975C Series GC\/MSD (Agilent)","organism":"Salmonella enterica","organism_parts":"whole organism","metabolites":["phosphoric acid","phosphoenolpyruvic acid","diphosphoric acid","putrescine","pyruvic acid","L-Lactic acid","myristic acid","spermidine","succinic acid","thymine","uracil","urea","urocanic acid","xanthine","L-homoserine","adenosine","deoxycytidylic acid","adenine","Beta- alanine","L-glutamic acid","1,3-diaminopropane","glyceric acid","6-deoxy-D-glucose","citramalic acid","D-glucose-6-phosphate","palmitoleic acid","oleic acid","4-guanidinobutyric acid","stearic acid","tyramine","L-cysteine","L-alanine","L-serine","L-aspartic acid","L-lysine","cytosine","fructose","L-tyrosine","L-leucine","L-methionine","L-proline","alpha-D-glucose","L-ornithine","L-histidine","L-valine","L-threonine","pantothenic acid","dihydroxyacetone phosphate","porphine","adenosine-5'-monophosphate","N-Acetyl-L-glutamic acid","glycine","DL-glyceraldehyde","glycerol","sn-Glycerol 3-phosphate","glycolic acid","hypoxanthine","L-isoleucine","2,6-diaminopimelic acid","malonic acid","D-malic acid","4-hydroxyphenyllactic acid","nicotinic acid","citrulline","palmitic acid","D-ribose"]}},"MTBLS355":{"description":["Nontargeted and targeted metabolomics measurements of abiotic stress responses in three-week-old Arabidopsis thaliana plants' rosette leaf tissue for Col-0 wild type plants and double\/triple knockout mutants of aquaporins (pip2;1 pip2;2 and pip2;1 pip2;2 pip2;4) treated with drought, heat at different air humidities, or combined drought-heat stress at different air humidities. This experiment contains FT-ICR-MS measurements for 103 Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaf samples covering three genotypes under six different environmental conditions. The three genotypes comprise the Col-0 wildtype and two loss-of-function mutants of aquaporins, a pip2;1 pip2;2 double mutant and a pip2;1 pip2;2 pip2;4 triple mutant (respective AGI locus identifiers: AT3G53420, AT2G37170, AT5G60660). The six conditions include control condition (well-watered, 22 \u00b0C, 70% relative air humidity), drought stress (one week without watering), heat stress without changing the absolute humidity of the ambient air (6 hours at 33 \u00b0C, 37% relative air humidity), heat stress with supplemented air humidity to maintain a constant vapor pressure deficit before and during the heat episode (6 hours at 33 \u00b0C, 84% relative air humidity), and the combinations of drought pretreatment with each of the two heat stress variants (one week of drought followed by 6 hours of heat stress). Samples from all conditions were harvested at the same time (within 15 min starting at 5 pm). For validation, GC-TOF-MS measurements were done for two genotypes (wildtype, double mutant) and two conditions (drought, control) on partially overlapping samples.","Sample collection: The plants were grown on soil in climate simulation chambers with 11\/13 h light\/dark cycle (light 08:30 am to 07:30 pm), 200 \u03bcmol\/m^2\/s photosynthetic photon flux density, 22 \u00b0C air temperature and 0.79 kPa VPD, corresponding to 70% relative air humidity. 3-week-old plants were flooded with water up to 60% of the pot height for 15 min by an automatic flooding system. After flooding, the plants used for drought stress (D) and combined drought and heat stresses (DH) stopped being watered and the soil moisture was regularly monitored. When the soil water content dropped to approximately 20% of the initial water content after 1 week, heat stress (H) was applied to both well-watered plants and drought-treated plants, raising the temperature to 33 \u00b0C for 6 h from 11:00 am to 5:00 pm. For 1 set of plants, the absolute air humidity was kept unchanged during the temperature increase, resulting in 37% relative air humidity and 3.17 kPa VPD; this condition is labeled 'LrH' (low relative air humidity). For another set of plants, the heat treatments were done with supplemented air humidity at 84% relative air humidity, to maintain the VPD at 0.79 kPa; the condition is labeled 'HrH' (high relative air humidity). 5 replicates of each genotype were generated for each environmental scenario; they were randomly distributed in the chambers to exclude position effects. Each replicate consisted of 7 or 8 rosettes that were harvested after treatment, collected into plastic bags (4 oz. 118 ml, Whirl-Pak), immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Samples from all conditions were harvested at the same time (within 15 min starting at 5:00 pm).","Extraction: FT-ICR-MS extraction: Samples were ground at 2500 rpm for 2.5 min using the mixer mill MM 400 (Retsch, Germany), and 100 mg powder used for metabolite extraction. Metabolite extraction was performed as described previously [1] with slight modifications. 44 \u03bcg\/ml loganin and 3 \u03bcg\/ml nitrophenol were added to extraction buffer 1 (methanol\/chloroform\/H2O 2.5:1:1 v\/v\/v) as internal standards. 2 ml pre-cooled extraction buffer 1 (-20 \u00b0C) was added to 100 mg plant material and mixed at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min. After centrifugation (10 min, 14000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C), 1 ml of the supernatant (supernatant A) was transferred into a fresh 2 ml Eppendorf tube and the remaining pellet was extracted in a second step with 1 ml pre-cooled (4 \u00b0C) extraction buffer 2 (methanol\/chloroform 1:1 v\/v). After a second centrifugation, 500 \u03bcl of the supernatant (supernatant B) were mixed with supernatant A. The chloroform phase was then separated from the water\/methanol phase by addition of 250 \u03bcl of HPLC grade water (4 \u00b0C, Merck). The aqueous phase was divided into several 200 \u03bcl aliquots and dried completely using a Speed-Vac. GC\u2013TOF\u2013MS extraction and derivatization: For the extraction ~100 mg plant material (fresh weight) was ground in 900 \u00b5l cold (-20 \u00b0C) 80% methanol containing 20 \u03bcl ribitol (0.2 mg\/ml in water) and 10 \u03bcl 13C-sorbitol (0.2 mg \/m in water), which were added as internal standards for the quantification of metabolite abundances. After incubation at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min, the extract was centrifuged for 15 min at 25000 x g. For further analysis, 50 \u03bcl of the supernatant was dried in vacuo. The pellet was resuspended in 10 \u03bcl of methoxyaminhydrochloride (20 mg\/ml in pyridine) and derivatized for 90 min at 37 \u00b0C. After the addition of 20 \u00b5l of BSTFA (N,O-Bis[trimethylsilyl]trifluoroacetamide) containing 5 \u03bcl retention time standard mixture of linear alkanes (n-decane, n-dodecane, n-pentadecane, n-nonadecane, n-docosane, n-octacosane, n-dotriacontane), the mix was incubated at 37 \u00b0C for further 45 min [2][3][4].

Samples were derivatized and injected by an autosampler system (Combi PAL, CTC Analytics AG, Zwingen, Switzerland). Helium acted as carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml\/min. Gas chromatography was performed on an Agilent GC (7890A, Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) using a 30 m VF-5ms column with 10 m EZ-Guard column. The injection temperature of the split\/splitless injector (Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) was set to 250 \u00b0C. Transfer line and ion source were set to 250 \u00b0C. The initial oven temperature (70 \u00b0C) was permanently increased to a final temperature of 320 \u00b0C by 9 \u00b0C\/min. To avoid solvent contaminations the solvent delay was set to 340 s. Metabolites that passed the column were released into the TOF-MS.","Mass spec: FT-ICR-MS: A Solarix FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a 12 Tesla magnet (Magnex, UK) was used for the experimental study. The electrospray ionization source (Apollo II, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) was used in the negative ionization mode to ionize the studied analytes in 50% methanolic solution (Lichrosolv, Sigma-Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany). The sample solutions were injected directly to the ionization source by the use of a microliter pump at a flow rate of 2 \u00b5l\/min. A source heater temperature of 200 \u00b0C was maintained and no nozzle \u2013 skimmer fragmentation was performed in the ionization source. The instrument was previously calibrated by the use of Arginine negative cluster ions starting from a methanolic arginine solution of 5 mg\/l. Ions were accumulated in the collision cell for 300 ms for thermalization and enrichment prior to ICR ion detection. The base pressure in the ICR vacuum chamber was 7 x 10^-10 mbar and in the quadrupole and hexapole regions 3 x 10^-6 mbar. High pressure in the quadrupole and hexapole regions is necessary to co-linearize the ions in the radial plane and decelerate the radial components of the ion kinetic energy. 300 scans were accumulated for each mass spectrum. The instrumental mass range m\/z (147-1000) amu was scanned. GC\u2013TOF\u2013MS: The transfer line, connecting the GC and the TOF-MS, was set to 250 \u00b0C as well as the ion source where the instreaming metabolites got ionized and fractionated by an ion pulse of 70 eV. Mass spectra were recorded at 20 scans\/s with an m\/z 35\u2013800 scanning range using a LECO Pegasus HT TOFMS. Chromatograms and mass spectra were evaluated using ChromaTOF 4.5 and TagFinder 4.1 software [1]. There are 2 files for each sample, splitless (suffix \"_SL\") and split 10 (suffix \"_Split\"). Highly abundant metabolites (sugars, organic acids) were measured in split mode, and other metabolites in splitless mode. The sample naming is consistent with the processed files.

Here we conducted experiments to determine the time and dose-dependent effects of NR on blood, liver and heart NAD+ metabolism in people and mice. We report that human blood cell NAD+ can rise as much as 2.7-fold with a single dose of NR, that NR elevates mouse hepatic NAD+ with distinct and superior pharmacokinetics to those of nicotinic acid (NA) and nicotinamide (Nam), and that single doses of 100, 300, and 1000 mg of NR provide a dose-dependent increase in the blood cell NAD+ metabolome in the first clinical trial of NR pharmacokinetics. We also report that nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NAAD), which was not thought to be en route for conversion of NR to NAD+, is formed from NR and that the rise in NAAD is a highly sensitive biomarker of effective NAD+ supplementation.","Sample collection: n=1 human experiment: After overnight fasting, a healthy 52 year old male self-administered 1000 mg of NR chloride orally at 8 am on 7 consecutive days. Blood and urine were taken for quantitative NAD+ metabolomic analysis. He took 0.25 g of NA to assess sensitivity to flushing and self-reported painful flushing that lasted 1 hr. No flushing was experienced on NR. The study was submitted for approval by the University of Iowa institutional review board (IRB), which ruled it not subject to human subjects research on the basis of informed self-administration [1]. Clinical trial: A randomized, double-blind, three-arm crossover pharmacokinetic study of oral NR chloride was performed at 100, 300, and 1000 mg doses (NCT02191462). Twelve healthy, non-pregnant subjects (6 male, 6 female) between the ages of 30 and 55 with body mass indices of 18.5 - 29.9 kg\/m2 were recruited and randomized to one of three treatment sequences after screening, passing eligibility criteria and providing informed consent. Subjects taking multi-vitamins, vitamin B3 in any form, or consuming diets that could contain unusually high amounts of NA, Nam or NR were excluded. Complete exclusion criteria are provided in Supplementary Materials. Overnight fasted subjects received a single morning dose of either 100 mg, 300 mg, or 1000 mg of NR on three test days separated by 7-day periods in which no supplement was given. To evaluate pharmacokinetics, blood was collected and separated into plasma and PBMC fractions for analysis of the NAD+ metabolome at pre-dose and again at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 hr. Urine was collected pre-dose and in 0 - 6 hr, 6 -12 hr and 12 - 24 hr fractions. Safety, vitals, biometrics, complete blood counts and a comprehensive metabolic panel were assessed at time zero and 24 hr after each dose. The study was reviewed and approved by the Natural Health Products Directorate, Health Canada and IRB Services, Aurora, Ontario. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject at the screening visit prior to all study-related activities. Mice: For gavage experiments, 12 week old male C57Bl\/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were housed 3 - 5 mice per cage on a chow diet (Teklad 7013) for one week prior to the experiment. Body weight-matched groups were randomly assigned to be given either 185 mg NR Cl \/kg body weight (n = 3) or equimole amounts of NA (n = 4) or Nam (n = 4) by saline gavage. On each sacrifice day, a saline injection (n = 3) was performed and served as time point zero and an additional saline gavage (n = 3) time course was performed. To avoid circadian effects, time courses were established such that all sacrifices were performed at ~ 2 pm. With protocols approved by the University of Iowa Office of Animal Resources, mice were live-decapitated and the medullary lobe of the liver was freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. For IP experiments, 6 - 8 week old, male C57Bl\/6J mice were injected with either phosphate buffered saline or 500 mg NR Cl \/kg body weight for six days. With protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Utah, mice were anesthetized by chloral hydrate and the liver and hearts were freeze-clamped at liquid nitrogen temperature. Tissues were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Ref: [1] Altman, L. K. Who Goes First: The Story of Self-experimentation in Medicine. (University of California Press, 1987).","Extraction: Dual extractions were carried out for complete analysis of the NAD+ metabolome. For analysis of NR, Nam, NA, MeNam, Me2PY, and Me4PY (group A analytes or Acid group), samples were spiked with 60 pmol of [18O1]-Nam, [18O1]-NR, and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and 240 pmol [D4]-NA (internal standard (IS) A). For analysis of NAD+, NADP+, NMN, NAR, NAMN, NAAD, and ADPR (group B analytes or Alkaline group), samples were dosed with 13C-yeast extract (IS B) as described [1]. For both human and mouse samples, samples were transferred to Waters polypropylene plastic total recovery vials (Part no. 186002639) after extraction or preparation and stored in a Waters Acquity H class autosampler maintained at 8 \u00b0C until injection. In all cases, 10 \u00b5l of extract was loaded onto the column. Human Samples: 100 \u00b5l of urine was mixed with 20 \u00b5l of IS A in 5% (v\/v) formic acid or IS B in water for the analysis of group A and B analytes, respectively. 50 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol was added and the mixture vortexed prior to centrifugation at 16.1 kg at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. Supernatants were injected without further dilution and analyzed as described below. Standard curves and quality controls for the complete analysis were prepared in the same manner as described for urine samples but in water. To quantify group A analytes in plasma, 100 \u00b5l of plasma was added to 20 \u00b5l of IS A prepared in 5% (v\/v) formic acid and mixed with 400 \u00b5l of ice-cold methanol. The mixture was allowed to sit on ice for 20 min then centrifuged as described for urine. After drying under vacuum overnight at 35 \u00b0C, the sample was reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of water. To quantify group B analytes, 100 \u00b5l of plasma was added to 10 \u00b5l of IS B in water and mixed with 300 \u00b5l of acetonitrile with vortexing for 15 sec. After briefly resting on ice, the samples were centrifuged as above. Supernatants were applied to Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges (Torrance, California, USA) and the flow-through collected. 200 \u00b5l of aqueous acetonitrile (4 volumes acetonitrile:1 volume water) was also applied and the flow through collected. The flow-through from both steps was combined and dried via speed vacuum. Samples were reconstituted in 60 \u00b5l of water. Standard curves and quality controls for both analyses were prepared in donor plasma (University of Iowa DeGowin Blood Center, Iowa City, IA, USA) and extracted using the same method employed for plasma samples.Blood cell fractions were thawed on ice and simultaneously extracted for both A and B analyses when possible. 100 \u00b5l of sample was added to either 20 \u00b5l of IS A in 5% formic acid (v\/v) or 10 \u00b5l IS B in water for quantification of group A and B analytes, respectively. Samples were then mixed with 300 \u00b5l of acetonitrile and vortexed for 15 sec. Samples were shaken for 5 min at 40 \u00b0C then centrifuged as described above. For group A analytes, supernatants were dried via speed vacuum overnight at 35 \u00b0C after this step. For group B analytes, supernatant was applied to Phenomenex Phree SPE cartridges and treated in the same manner as described above for quantification of group B analytes in plasma. Immediately prior to analysis, samples were reconstituted in either 100 \u00b5l of 10 mM ammonium acetate with 0.1% formic acid (for group A analyte quantification) or 100 \u00b5l of 5% (v\/v) aqueous methanol (for group B analyte quantification). Standard curves were prepared in water and processed in the same manner as samples. Murine Samples: Murine liver and heart obtained by freeze-clamp was pulverized using a Bessman pulverizer (100 \u2013 1000 mg size) (Spectrum Laboratories, Rancho Dominguez, California) cooled to liquid N2 temperatures. Each pulverized liver and heart sample was aliquoted (5 \u2013 20 mg) into two liquid N2 cooled 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, which were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Prior to extraction, IS A and IS B were added to separate aliquots resting on dry ice for quantification of group A and B analytes, respectively. Samples were extracted by addition of 0.1 ml of buffered ethanol (3 volumes ethanol: 1 volume 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.1) at 80 \u00b0C. Samples were vortexed vigorously until thawed, sonicated in a bath sonicator (10 sec followed by 15 sec on ice, repeated twice for liver and thrice for heart), vortexed, then placed into a Thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) set to 80 \u00b0C and shaken at 1050 rpm for five min. Samples were centrifuged as described above. Clarified supernatants were transferred to fresh 1.5 ml tubes and dried via speed vacuum for two h. Prior to LC-MS\/MS analysis, samples were resuspended in 40 \u00b5l of 10 mM ammonium acetate (>99% pure) in LCMS-grade water. Sample preparation following [13C1, D1]-NR administration differed only in the following respect. 60 pmol of [D4]-Nam and [D3, 18O1]-MeNam and 240 pmol of [D4]-NA was added to sample in lieu of IS A. Standard curves were performed without extraction in water. Ref: [1] Trammell SA, Brenner C. Targeted, LCMS-based Metabolomics for Quantitative Measurement of NAD(+) Metabolites.

MeNam, Me2PY, and Me4PY were added to the analysis and detected using the following transitions: MeNam (m\/z 137 > 94, cone voltage = 8 V, collision energy = 20 V); Me2PY (m\/z 153 > 107, cone voltage = 44 V, collision energy = 22 V); and Me4PY (m\/z 153 > 136, cone voltage = 24 V, collision energy = 14 V). For the analysis of urine, plasma, and murine liver, group A analytes were separated as described for the acid separation. In blood cells, group A analytes were separated on a 2.1 x 150 mm Synergy Fusion-RP (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, US) using the same gradient and mobile phase as described for the acid separation. For human samples, group B analytes were separated using the mobile phase and gradient as previously described for the alkaline separation. Murine liver extracts were analyzed using a slightly altered alkaline separation on a 2.1 x 100 mm Thermo Hypercarb column. Specifically, flow rate was increased to 0.55 ml\/min and run time shortened to 11.6 min. Separation was performed using a modified gradient with initial equilibration at 3% B, a 0.9 min hold, a gradient to 50% B over 6.3 min, followed by a 1 min wash at 90% B and a 3 min re-equilibration at 3% B.

Analysis of enrichment in murine liver was performed with a Waters Q-TOF Premier mass spectrometer operated in positive ion, full scan mode with the same LC conditions as described for non-enrichment experiments. Enrichment data were corrected for natural isotope abundance based on theoretical isotope distribution, 13-carbon abundance skew, and the purity of the labeled standard (3\/97% [13C1]-NR\/[13C1, D1]-NR). Quantitation was performed on the Waters TQD as described above and used to determine the quantity of non-labeled and labeled metabolites.","Data transformation: Analytes were quantified in mol amounts using QuanLynx V4.1. These mol amounts were normalized to wet tissue weight in murine studies. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were normalized to blood volume.

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed nontargeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29 \u00b1 4 y of age) and 15 elderly (81 \u00b1 7 y of age) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV = SD\/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found 14 blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, and NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in antioxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson\u2019s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. Although our CV values are mostly consistent with those CVs previously published, we here report previously unidentified CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4\u20132.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values, such as ATP and glutathione, may be related to various diseases because their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus, human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences. <\/p> In human 24 hr metabolome observation (non-fasting) four volunteers were taken blood after overnight fast without breakfast at 9:00; 10:00, 13:00 and before lunch on the first day. Volunteers had lunches and dinners as usual on that day. On the second day after overnight fast the blood was sampled again at 9:00 at Kyoto university hospital laboratory. The great majority of metabolites hardly fluctuated (117 from 126 metabolites varied less than 2.5-fold on average in four volunteers). <\/p> Data from three injections of the same sample and three samples prepared from the same donated blood are available under accession number MTBLS263.

The confinement of HBV replication to the liver, which also acts as the central hub for metabolic and nutritional regulation, emphasizes the interlinked nature of host metabolism and the disease. Still, the metabolic processes operational during the distinct clinical phases of a chronic HBV infection\u2014immune tolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases\u2014remains unexplored. <\/p> Methods: To investigate this, we conducted a targeted metabolomics approach on serum to determine the metabolic progression over the clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, using patient samples grouped based on their HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and HBeAg serum levels. <\/p> Results: Our data illustrate the strength of metabolomics to provide insight into the metabolic dysregulation experienced during chronic HBV. The immune tolerant phase is characterized by the speculated viral hijacking of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle, explaining the reduced glycerophospholipid and increased plasmalogen species, indicating a strong link to HBV replication. The persisting impairment of the choline glycerophospholipids, even during the inactive carrier phase with minimal HBV activity, alludes to possible metabolic imprinting effects. The progression of chronic HBV is associated with increased concentrations of very long chain triglycerides together with citrulline and ornithine, reflective of a dysregulated urea cycle peaking in the HBV envelope antigen-negative phase. <\/p> Conclusions: The work presented here will aid in future studies to (i) validate and understand the implication of these metabolic changes using a thorough systems biology approach, (ii) monitor and predict disease severity, as well as (iii) determine the therapeutic value of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle. <\/p> The Lipid assays and the Biogenic amine and Acyl-carnitine assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights studies MTBLS279 and MTBLS280 respectively.","Sample collection: Study population: 69 chronic HBV patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this discovery study. Blood was prospectively collected in SST tubes at the Erasmus MC and centrifuged to separate the serum and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Patients were treatment na\u00efve and excluded if they had other chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus) or a body mass index of 31 or more. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The ethical review board of the Erasmus MC approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients who were asked to donate blood. Definition of chronic HBV clinical phases: Serum ALT was measured on an automated analyzer, qualitative serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and anti-HBeAg antibodies (Abs) were measured on an Architect Abbott analyzer, and serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS AmpliPrep-COBAS Taq- Man HBVv2test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Based on serum HBV DNA, ALT levels and HBeAg presence at the time of sampling, patients were categorized into four clinical HBV phases according to international guidelines[1]. Immune tolerant (IT, n=18) patients had detectable serum HBeAg and repetitive normal ALT values (<40 U\/l). The HBeAg-positive immune active (IA, n=12) and HBeAg-negative (ENEG, n=19) patients had repetitive or intermittent abnormal serum ALT (>40 U\/l) values, and HBV DNA levels >2,000 IU\/ml. Inactive carrier (IC, n=20) patients were HBeAg-negative and had both repetitive normal ALT values (<40 IU\/l) and HBV DNAllevels below 20,000 IU\/ml.

The abundant neurotransmitter N-acetylaspartylglutamate (NAAG), for example, was over 2-fold higher in Abcc5-\/- brain. In line with ABCC5-mediated transport, the metabolites that accumulated in Abcc5-\/- tissues were depleted in cultured cells that overexpressed human ABCC5.

Glutamate conjugates are of physiological relevance because they can affect the function of glutamate, the principal excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain. Interestingly, we found that ABCC5 also transports exogenous glutamate analogs, like the classic excitotoxic neurotoxins kainic acid, domoic acid and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), and the therapeutic glutamate analog ZJ43.

We analysed data from the model legume Lotus japonicus, obtained through six independent, longterm, non-lethal salt stress experiments which were carried out over two consecutive years. Best possible controlled greenhouse conditions were applied and two main questions asked: how reproducible are results obtained from physiologically meaningful salinity experiments, and what degree of bias may be expected if conclusions are drawn from less well-repeated sampling. A surprisingly large fraction of the transcriptional and metabolic responses to salt stress were not reproducible between experiments. A core set of robust changes was found that was shared between experiments. Many of these robust responses were qualitatively and quantitatively conserved between different accessions of the same species, indicating that the robust responses may be a sound starting point for translational genomics.","Sample collection: Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16\/8 h day\/night regime, 23 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, 55\u201365% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.

Urine samples, in concurrence with breath and blood samples, were taken from 51 participants (23 controls, 11 type-1 diabetes, 17 type-2 diabetes) during the Dutch endurance walking event, the International Four Days Marches. Multivariate analysis allowed for discrimination of before and after exercise for all three groups (control, type-1 and type-2 diabetes) and on three out of 4 days. The analysis highlighted 12 molecular ions contributing to this discrimination. Of these, acetic acid in urine is identified as a significant marker for exercise effects induced by walking; an increase is observed as an effect of walking. Analysis of acetone concentration with univariate tools resulted in different information when compared to breath as a function of exercise, revealing an interesting effect of time over the 4 days. In breath, acetone provides an immediate snapshot of metabolism, whereas urinary acetone will result from longer term diffusion processes, providing a time averaged view of metabolism. The potential to use PTR-MS measurements of urine to monitor exercise effects is exhibited, and may be utilized to monitor subjects in mass participation exercise events.","Sample collection: All subjects participated in the International Four Days Marches, July 2012, an annual walking event in Nijmegen, the Netherlands, organized by the Dutch Walking Organization (KNBLO-NL). In total 51 participants gave urine samples. Among them 23 were control (CT), 11 type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) and 17 type-2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Participants included 28 males and 23 females with an age range of 25\u201385 years. Depending on their age and gender, participants walked 30, 40 or 50 km per day. Urine samples were collected twice a day for 4 consecutive days from each subject, once in the morning, prior to walking (between 3:30 am and 8:30 am) and another at the end of the walk (between 10:30 am and 17:30 pm).","Extraction: After collection, the samples were transported via a cooler (~6 \u00b0C) to a storage freezer of temperature -80 \u00b0C. Samples were without any centrifuge separation and without any anti-bacterial additives. The samples were later defrosted, separated into two vials and refrozen. One vial was used for VOCs analysis with PTR-MS.","Chromatography: Not applicable.","Mass spec: Urine measurements were performed with an in-house built proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS). A detailed description of this instrument has been given elsewhere [1]. Briefly, proton transfer reaction is a soft ionization method in which VOCs with molecular mass (M) are ionized by the transfer of a proton from a hydronium ion (H3O+), and are detected at mass M + 1 using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Samples to be measured by PTR-MS were removed from the freezer the night before the measurements to defrost at room temperature (~20 \u00b0C). The following day the instrument was calibrated and samples prepared and measured. 10 ml of urine was transferred from the vial to a glass cuvette with a 40 ml available volume. The closing lid of the glass cuvette was sealed in place with a metal fastening clip and an O-ring, with one gas inlet and one gas outlet port to allow sampling. A constant flow of 2 l\/h of air was passing through the cuvette to flush the head space. The outlet for this flow was side sampled by the PTR-MS at 1.5 l\/h. For the duration of the measurement the samples remained at room temperature. The intensity of the VOC signal was observed to decrease with time, due to the continuous flushing of the headspace. Therefore, to prevent the concentration declining, the headspace was flushed and measured for 4 min only for each sample. Beyond this time the headspace concentration drop becomes unacceptable (more than 18% drop). Three samples were measured sequentially using an automatic valve system [2] to switch between each cuvette. The product ion intensities, measured in counts per seconds (cps) were normalized to reagent ion signal, which gave intensities in normalized counts per second (ncps). These were further normalized to creatinine concentrations (mmol) to give final units of ncps\/mmol1. This allowed the detected signals to be normalized with respect to the level of biological dilution present in the sample [3]. For the duration of analysis, the transfer lines from the valves to the PTR-MS were heated up to 55 \u00b0C to prevent condensation. The consistency of the analysis was checked by calibrating each day, before the start of the experiment with a standard gas mixture consisting of methanol (m\/z 33), acetaldehyde (m\/z 45), acetone (m\/z 59), isoprene (m\/z 69), benzene (m\/z 79), toluene (m\/z 93), O-xylene (m\/z 107) and alpha-pinene (m\/z 137), each in 1000 ppbv \u00b1 5% (ppbv = part per billion volume) in a nitrogen dilution gas (Linde, Dieren, the Netherlands). The calibration was performed using different concentrations, from 35 to 1000 ppbv obtained by dilution of the standard mixture with nitrogen gas. Ref: [1] Steeghs, M., Bais, H.

Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on \u201cultrafast\u201d experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism.<\/p>NMR Calibration Standard corresponding to the MTBLS131 datasets.","Sample collection: Reference standards were commercially purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, and prepared in-house.","Extraction: The particularity of 2D NMR for quantitative analysis is that the peak volumes depend on several factors in addition to the concentration. Building a calibration curve for each targeted metabolite is therefore indispensable\u2014still, a single series of calibration samples containing all the targeted metabolites together is sufficient, and better reflects the complexity of the extracts. For this purpose, five calibration samples containing eight targeted metabolites at different concentrations were prepared in the phosphate buffer solution used to prepare the fruit extracts. The values of these concentrations (see Supplementary Table S2 in the paper associated with this study) were determined from previous profiling studies performed on tomato pericarp [1][2]. To keep a similar ionic force across the calibration range, the changes in the concentrations of these eight metabolites were not uniform. As with the fruit extracts reported in MTBLS131 and MTBLS132, the calibration samples were also titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added.

All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 4.5 ppm in both dimensions at 500 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS\u2022N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 500 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 64 and N1 = 1, as interleaving was not needed to sample the relevant spectral width. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G\/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G\/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G\/cm and 256 \u00b5s.

After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples. To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a\u2022[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample. To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite.

Our recent work using transcriptional data to predict metabolite levels in cancer cells led to preliminary evidence of the antiproliferative role of menaquinone (vitamin K2) in the Jurkat cell line model of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, nothing is known about the direct metabolic impacts of menaquinone in cancer, which could provide insights into its mechanism of action. Here, we used metabolomics to investigate the process by which menaquinone exerts antiproliferative activity on Jurkat cells. We first validated the dose-dependent, semi-selective, pro-apoptotic activity of menaquinone treatment on Jurkat cells relative to non-cancerous lymphoblasts. We then used mass spectrometry-based metabolomics to identify systems-scale changes in metabolic dynamics that are distinct from changes induced in noncancerous cells or by other chemotherapeutics. One of the most significantly affected metabolites was phosphoethanolamine, which exhibited a two-fold increase in menaquinone-treated Jurkat cells compared to vehicle-treated cells at 24 h, growing to a five-fold increase at 72 h. Phosphoethanolamine elevation was observed prior to the induction of apoptosis, and was not observed in menaquinonetreated lymphoblasts or chemotherapeutic-treated Jurkat cells. We also validated the link between menaquinone and phosphoethanolamine in an ovarian cancer cell line, suggesting potentially broad applicability of their relationship. This metabolomics-based work is the first detailed characterization of the metabolic impacts of menaquinone treatment and the first identified link between phosphoethanolamine and menaquinone-induced apoptosis.","Sample collection: The Jurkat cells and normal lymphoblasts were seeded at a density of 200000 cells\/ml in T75 tissue culture flasks. Cells were treated with 25 & 35 \u00b5M menaquinone (MQ, vitamin K2), 0.02 \u00b5M docetaxel, 0.4 \u00b5M doxorubicin and DMSO-vehicle control in new media at 24h after seeding. All treatments were performed in biological triplicate. Cell suspensions for metabolite extractions were collected from the same flasks at 0, 24, 48 & 72 h after the treatments and subjected to fast filtration and quenching.","Extraction: Vacuum assisted-fast filtration on a vacuum manifold (Pall, Port Washington, NY, USA) was used to quickly remove media, followed by a 10 ml PBS wash. Filters (47 mm, 0.45 \u00b5M, PES; Millipore, Billerica, MA, US; catalog #HPWP04700) capturing the cells were immediately transferred to 1.5 ml of -80 \u00b0C methanol in a petri dish (60 mm x 15 mm) on dry ice and stored at -80 \u00b0C for 24 h for thorough extraction. The filters were rinsed with the methanol cell suspension, and the suspension was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes, vigorously mixed for 30 sec and centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min at -5 \u00b0C. Supernatants were collected and pellets were re-suspended in 250 \u00b5l of cold 100% methanol and centrifuged at the same conditions. Supernatants were pooled, and pellets were re-suspended in 250 \u00b5l ice cold ultrapure water and centrifuged at 5000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. The following labelling conventions were used for naming the samples: J represents - Jurkat cell line (Leukemia) L represents - Noncancerous lymphoblast cell line The numbers 0, 24, 48, 72 represents the time (h) post exposure to the treatments A - Solvent treated control B - 25 \u00b5M menaquinone treatment C - 35 \u00b5M menaquinone treatment 1 - biological replicate 1 2 - biological replicate 2 3 - biological replicate 3 Doxo - Doxorubicin treated control Doce - Docetaxel treated control ","Chromatography: An Agilent 7683B autosampler fitted to an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph adapted to GCxGC analysis was used. The first column was an HP-5, 30 m long x 0.320 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and the second was an Rtx-200, 2 m long x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Restek, Bellefonte, PA, USA). Helium was used as the carrier gas with a corrected constant flow rate of 1.00 ml\/min. The inlet septum purge flow was maintained at 3 ml\/min. The inlet was functioning in splitless mode with a purge flow of 100 ml\/min delayed to start 30 seconds after injection, giving a total flow of 101 ml\/min. Runs were performed in a gas saver mode with a flow of 20 ml\/min set to start a minute after injection. Front inlet temperature was set at 250 \u00b0C for the entire run. The primary oven temperature was held at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min and the temperature was ramped at 10 \u00b0C\/min until 315 \u00b0C and held for 2 min. The secondary oven temperature and the modulator temperature offsets were 5 \u00b0C and 20 \u00b0C above the main oven respectively. One minute equilibration time was set for the ovens. The transfer line temperature was maintained at 320 \u00b0C for the entire run. From start to 450 s, a modulation period of 5 s was programmed with 1.00 s hot pulse and 1.50 s cool time. Modulation period was 6 s from 450 to 756 with 1.50 s each hot pulse and cool time. Modulation was reduced back to 5 s from 756 till the end of run with the hot and cold pulse of 1.50 s and 1.00 s respectively.","Mass spec: A Leco Pegasus 4D time of flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) with electron impact ionization was used for mass analysis. Filaments were turned off for the initial 400 s to delay mass acquisition until after the solvent peak. The mass scanning range was from 50 to 500 u with a sampling rate of 200 spectra\/s. The detector voltage was set at 100 V above the optimized voltage with an electron energy of -70 V. Manual mass defect mode was used with the mass defect 0 mu\/100 u. Ion source temperature was required to reach 220 \u00b0C before starting mass acquisition.","Data transformation: None","Metabolite id: Date output from instrument was first analyzed with ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identities. Software settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.25 s, and a match of 700 was required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S\/N) of 10 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S\/N of 100 and a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for peak area calculation. To align the samples, MetPP (http:\/\/metaopen.sourceforge.net\/metpp.html) was used, along with the extraction blank file used for peak deduction. Unknowns were retained during peak alignment. On-the-fly alignment was used with quality control samples manually selected as the peak list for primary alignment. Peak alignment was performed using the default criteria. After alignment, further processing of the data was done to remove any batch effects from the data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if more than half of the values in biological replicates were missing. (However, we note that for the OVCAR-3 validation experiments, since only one metabolite was being tested and there were very few samples, direct results from ChromaTOF were used because the downstream analysis steps were either unnecessary or inappropriate.) Annotated analytes were then compared to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB); if they were listed in KEGG and HMDB they were considered annotated as metabolites. The metabolites were then verified by a manual confirmation of similarity between the annotated peak spectrum and the library spectrum."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS226","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS226","title":"Metabolomics identifies

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

To infer causality, experiments in representative models are essential, but widely used animal models exhibit limitations. Here we present a modular, microfluidics-based model (HuMiX, human\u2013microbial crosstalk), which allows co-culture of human and microbial cells under conditions representative of the gastrointestinal human\u2013microbe interface. We demonstrate the ability of HuMiX to recapitulate in vivo transcriptional, metabolic and immunological responses in human intestinal epithelial cells following their co-culture with the commensal Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG) grown under anaerobic conditions. In addition, we show that the co-culture of human epithelial cells with the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides caccae and LGG results in a transcriptional response, which is distinct from that of a co-culture solely comprising LGG. HuMiX facilitates investigations of host\u2013microbe molecular interactions and provides insights into a range of fundamental research questions linking the gastrointestinal microbiome to human health and disease.","Sample collection: For biomolecular extractions on the adherent Caco-2 cells, the gasket\u2013membrane assemblies were first washed in a 0.9% (w\/v) NaCl solution. The cells were then immediately treated with 800 \u03bcl of an ice-cold 1:1 methanol:water (v\/v) solution. Subsequently, the cells were disrupted and detached from the membranes using a plastic scrapper (VWR). The methanol:water suspension containing cells was then placed into a 2 ml sample tube and 400 \u03bcl of ice-cold chloroform was added. The sample mixtures were briefly vortexed and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate the polar and non-polar metabolite phases and to concentrate the interphase pellets which were subsequently used for the extraction of biomacromolecules (RNA, DNA and proteins). The Caco-2 interphase pellets were then processed using the Qiagen AllPrep DNA\/RNA\/Protein Mini Kit [1]. The fractions of DNA, RNA and proteins fractions were sequentially isolated and snap frozen. All extracts (except DNA fractions) were preserved at -80\u00b0C until further analysis. For the biomolecular extractions on the microbial cell contingents, the microbial cells were immediately disrupted and detached from the semi-permeable membranes using a plastic scrapper (VWR) and placed in a 0.9% (w\/v) NaCl solution. This solution was then placed in a 2 ml sample tube and centrifuged at 4,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to pellet the bacteria. The supernatant was discarded and the bacterial pellet was snap-frozen. The bacterial pellet was then lysed using a Precellys lysis kit and polar and non-polar metabolites fractions were obtained.

The study participants have previously participated in a telephone interview called Screening Across the Lifespan Twin Study, conducted between 1998 and 2002. To be included in TwinGene, both twins within a pair had to be alive. In total, 12591 individuals participated by donating blood to the study, and by answering questionnaires about life style and health. For the purpose of metabolomic profiling, we designed a case-cohort of incident coronary heart disease, diabetes, dementia and ischemic stroke events and a matched sub-cohort (controls) stratified on age and sex. In the final analysis we included serum samples from 2,139 individuals.","Sample collection: The Swedish Twin Registry is a population-based national register including over 194,000 Swedish twins born from 1886 to 2008 [1]. TwinGene is a longitudinal study nested within the Swedish Twin Register initiated to examine associations between genetic factors and cardiovascular disease in Swedish twins. Twins born before 1958 and who has participated in a telephone screening between 1998 and 2002 were re-contacted between April 2004 and December 2008. Health and medication data were collected from self-reported questionnaires, and a blood sampling kit was mailed to the subject who then contacted a local health care center for blood sampling and a health check-up. Contacts were allowed on Monday to Thursday mornings (not the day before a national holiday), to ensure that the sample would reach the KI Biobank in Stockholm the following day by over night mail. The participants were instructed to fast from 8 PM (20:00) the previous night. A total volume of 50 ml of blood was drawn from each individual by venipuncture. First, a tube containing Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was filled and inverted 5 times immediately. These plasma samples were used for DNA extraction. Second, three gel tubes were filled, inverted 5 times immediately, let stand for 30 min for coagulation at room temperature, centrifuge for 10-15 min at 3800 rpm. Thus, the serum was tapped from the gel tubes to a collection tube and placed in a transport cylinder. These serum samples were used for storage and for the following metabolomics analysis. Serum samples for biochemical analysis were collected in the same way. Tubes were sent to Karolinska University Laboratory by overnight post where they were frozen at -80 \u00b0C in liquid nitrogen until analysis. In total, 12,591 individuals (55% women) participated by donating blood to the study, and by answering questionnaires about life style and health. Metabolomics was performed in a subsample of TwinGene. Specifically, we utilized a case-cohort design by selecting all the incident cases of coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, ischemic strokes and dementia up to 31st December 2010 and a sub-cohort (controls) of 1,643 individuals (43% women). The subcohort was stratified on median age and sex, and for each of the four strata, we randomly selected a number of participants proportional to the corresponding number of cases. In total, 2,139 individuals had metabolomic profiling data available. Ref: [1] Magnusson PK, Almqvist C, Rahman I, Ganna A, Viktorin A, Walum H, Halldner L et.al.

This 80% methanol solution was stored at -20 \u00baC overnight, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 3800 x g in 4 \u00baC to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was aliquoted to 3 separate 96-well plates, sealed using a heat-seal foil, and stored at -20 \u00baC until analysis. Plate analysis order was completely randomized for each set of injections, and plates were run in batches of 2 plates, reflecting the autosampler capacity. Within each set of 2 plates, the run order was again completely randomized to prevent injection order artifacts. Duplicate injections were performed for all samples, with the second set of injections performed upon completion of the first set of injections for all samples.","Chromatography: One \u00b5l injections of protein-precipitated serum were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. Separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C8 column (1.8 \u00b5m, 1.0 x 100 mm), using a gradient from solvent A (95% water, 5% methanol, 0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (95% methanol, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid). Injections were made in 100% A, which was held for 0.1 min, ramped to 40% B in 0.9 min, to 70% B over 2 min, and to 100% B over 8 min. The mobile phase was held at 100% B for 6 min, returned to starting conditions over 0.1 min, and allowed to re-equilibrate at for 5.9 min. Flow rate was constant at 140 \u00b5l\/min for the duration of the run. The column was held at 50 \u00baC, while samples were held at 10 \u00baC.","Mass spec: Column eluent was infused into a Waters Xevo G2 QTOF MS fitted with an electrospray source. Data was collected in positive ion mode, scanning from 50-1200 at a rate of 5 scans per second. Scans were collected alternatively in MS mode at collision energy of 6 V and in idMS\/MS mode using higher collision energy (15-30 V). IdMS\/MS (also called MSE or MSn) allows for unbiased view of MS\/MS fragmentation without additional experiments. Calibration was performed prior to sample analysis via infusion of sodium formate solution, with mass accuracy within 1 ppm. The capillary voltage was held at 2200 V, the source temp at 150 \u00baC, and the desolvation temperature at 350 \u00baC at a nitrogen desolvation gas flow rate of 800 l\/hr. The quadrupole was held at collision energy of 6 V.","Data transformation: Raw data files were converted to .cdf format using Waters DataBridge software for processing.","Metabolite id: Raw data were processed using XCMS software [1]. Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group [2]; the code has been made publically available at https:\/\/github.com\/andgan\/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS\/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features [3]. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite. Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative [4]. Normalization: First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded. Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded.

atoms), saturated fatty acids are associated with insulin resistance and the risk of type 2 diabetes. Although causality cannot be inferred from association studies, patients in whom the primary cause of insulin resistance can be genetically defined, offer unique opportunities to address this challenge. Therefore, we compared metabolite profiles in patients with congenital lipodystrophy or loss-of-function insulin resistance (INSR) mutations with healthy controls. The absence of significant differences in TAG species in the INSR group suggest that changes previously observed in epidemiological studies are not purely a consequence of insulin resistance. The presence of TAGs with lower carbon numbers and high saturation in patients with lipodystrophy suggests that these metabolite changes may be associated with primary adipose tissue dysfunction. The observed pattern of TAG species is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL). To test this we investigated the distribution of these TAGs in lipoprotein fractions using size exclusion chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. This associated these TAGs with VLDL particles, and hence release of TAGs into the blood from the liver. To test further the hepatic origin of these TAGs we induced DNL in the mouse, comparing ob\/ob and wild type mice on a chow or high fat diet, confirming that DNL induced an increase in relatively shorter, more saturated fatty acids. Overall, these studies highlight DNL in the pathogenesis of metabolic dyslipidaemia in states where energy intake exceeds the capacity of adipose tissue. <\/p> The protocols and data for mice samples are reported in current study MTBLS327.<\/br> The protocols and data for human samples are reported in study MTBLS162.","Sample collection: Male ob\/ob mice and their wild type (C57Bl\/6J) were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility, with a 12 h:12 h light\u2013dark cycle and access to water ad libitum. Mice (n = 10\/age group\/genotype) fed on a regular chow diet (caloric content of 11.5% fat, 26.9% protein, 61.6% carbohydrate) were sacrificed at the age of 4 months. A separate group of mice was switched to a custom-produced high fat diet (caloric content of 55% fat, 29% protein, 16% carbohydrate) at 12 weeks and sacrificed at the age of 4 months. Blood plasma was collected by cardiac bleed and liver tissue collected and rapidly frozen post mortem. Blood plasma (15 \u03bcl) and liver tissue (100 mg) were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further analysis.","Extraction: Mouse plasma samples (15 \u03bcl) were extracted using an automated Flexus sample preparation unit to minimize experimental variation. The samples, QC samples and blanks were placed in a predefined random order across the 96-well plate. For the QC samples, a pooled aliquot was created by mixing 10 \u03bcl of all samples to create the QC. Each plasma sample was placed into 1.2 ml Cryovials for the Flexus to sample. To each vial 100 \u03bcl of MilliQ water was added and thoroughly mixed. The solution (100 \u03bcl) was transferred to a glass coated 2.4 ml deep well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK). CH3OH (250 \u03bcl) was added containing six internal standards (0.6 \u03bcM 1,2-di-o-octadecyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocoline, 1.2 \u03bcM 1,2-di-O-phytanyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine, 0.6 \u03bcM C8-ceramide, 0.6 \u03bcM N-heptadecanoyl-D-erythro-sphingosylphosporylcholine, 6.2 \u03bcM undecanoic acid, 0.6 \u03bcM trilaurin), and then 500 \u03bcl of methyl tert-butyl ether was added and mixed. The plates were sealed using Corning aluminium microplate sealing tape (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and shaken for 10 min at 600 rpm, after which the plate was transferred to a centrifuge and spun for 10 min at 6000 rpm. Each well in theresulting plate had two layers, with an aqueous layer at the bottom and a hydrophobic layer on top containing the lipid extract. A 96-head micro-dispenser (Hydra Matrix, Thermo Fisher Ltd, Hemel Hampstead, UK) was used to transfer 25 \u03bcl of the hydrophobic layer to a glass-coated 25 \u03bcl low well plate (Plate+, Esslab, Hadleigh, UK) and with 90 \u03bcl of 7.5 mM NH4Ac IPA:MeOH (2:1) using a Hydra Matrix, after which the plate was sealed using Corning aluminium microplate sealing tape (Sigma Aldrich, UK) and stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis.","Chromatography: Not applicable.","Mass spec: Lipidomics was performed on the extract using chip-based nanoelectrospray with an Advion TriVersa Nanomate interfaced to the Thermo Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Scientific), using a mass acquisition window from 200 to 2000 m\/z and acquisition in positive mode. The Nanomate infusion mandrel was used to pierce the seal of each well before analysis, after which a fresh tip was prewetted by three repeat mixes of 6.5 \u03bcl of the sample and 5 \u03bcl was aspirated, followed by an air gap (1.5 \u03bcl). The tip was pressed against a fresh nozzle and the sample was dispensed using 0.3 psi nitrogen pressure. A voltage of 1.2 kV was used in positive mode and \u22121.5 kV in negative mode with an acquisition time of 72 s in both modes and a total analysis time of ~3 min per sample. The tip was discarded and replaced for each sample to minimise sample carry-over. Throughout the acquisition the sample plate was kept at 15 \u00b0C.","Data transformation: Acquired spectral raw data were processed using an in-house bioinformatics platform based on XCMS[1]. This performed sample-specific mass re-calibration using predefined sets of internal standards and the removal of commonly present contaminant ions (often associated with plasticizers) with help of predefined rejection lists and mass defect filters. The raw data were converted to .mzXML (using MSconvert[2] with peakpick level 1), parsed with R and 50 (scan from 20 to 70) spectra were averaged per sample using XCMS[1], with a signal cutoff at 2000. The files were aligned using the XCMS[1][3] grouping function using \u201cmzClust\u201d with a m\/z-window of 22 ppm and a minimum coverage of 60%, giving 1699 signals.

Few studies have sought robust responses of model plants to environmental stresses, such as salinity, by altering the stress dosage or by repeating experiments in consecutive years and\/or different seasons.We mined our published and unpublished data on legume salt acclimation for robust system features at the ionomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. We analysed data from the model legume Lotus japonicus, obtained through six independent, longterm, non-lethal salt stress experiments which were carried out over two consecutive years. Best possible controlled greenhouse conditions were applied and two main questions asked: how reproducible are results obtained from physiologically meaningful salinity experiments, and what degree of bias may be expected if conclusions are drawn from less well-repeated sampling. A surprisingly large fraction of the transcriptional and metabolic responses to salt stress were not reproducible between experiments. A core set of robust changes was found that was shared between experiments. Many of these robust responses were qualitatively and quantitatively conserved between different accessions of the same species, indicating that the robust responses may be a sound starting point for translational genomics.","Sample collection: Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16\/8 h day\/night regime, 23 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, 55\u201365% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.

Evidence suggests that Candida enhances the virulence of Staphylococcus - hyphae penetrate through tissue barriers, while S. aureus tightly associates with the hyphae to obtain entry to the host organism. Indeed, in a biofilm state, C. albicans enhances the antimicrobial resistance characteristics of S. aureus. The association of these microorganisms is also associated with significantly increased morbidity and mortality. Due to this tight association we hypothesised that metabolic effects were also in evidence.<\/br> Objectives: To explore the interaction, we used a novel GC-Orbitrap \u2013 based mass spectrometer, the QExactive GC, which combines the high peak capacity and chromatographic resolution of gas chromatography with the sub-ppm mass accuracy of an Orbitrap system. This allows the capability to leverage the widely available electron ionisation libraries for untargeted applications, along with expanding accurate mass libraries and targeted matches based around authentic standards.<\/br> Methods: Optimised C. albicans and S. aureus mono- and co-cultured biofilms were analysed in addition to the fresh and spent bacterial growth media.<\/br> Results: The targeted analysis experiment was based around 36 sugars and sugar phosphates, 22 amino acids and five organic acids. We detected an additional 22 highly scoring compounds from untargeted analysis.<\/br> Conclusion: Many of the results were as expected \u2013 rapid consumption of glucose and fructose from the medium regardless of the cell type. We also detected trehalose from the untargeted data, only in medium that contained C. albicans, commensurate with it being a predominantly fungal sugar. Notable from the results is that the pentose phosphate pathway appears to be enhanced in the cells from co-cultured biofilms.","Sample collection: Candida and Staphylococcus stains and culture conditions: Candida albicans laboratory strain SC5314 (ATCC MYA-2876) was used in this study. C. albicans was sub-cultured on Sabouraud\u2019s dextrose (SAB) agar (Fluka Analytical, India) and grown at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h and maintained at 4 \u00b0C. Broths were prepared by inoculating yeast peptone dextrose (YPD) medium (Sigma Life Sciences, USA), followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C, at 188 rpm, for 16-18 h. Staphylococcus aureus Newman strain (NCTC 8178\/ATCC) was cultured on Luria Bertani (LB) agar (Sigma Life Sciences, USA) and incubated for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C before being maintained at 4 \u00b0C. Overnight cultures were incubated aerobically in LB broth (Sigma Life Sciences, USA) in a shaking incubator set to 37 \u00b0C, at a speed of 188 rpm, for 16-18 h. Biofilm culture conditions: Overnight cultures of C. albicans and S. aureus were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min (Heraeus Megafuge 16R, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany) and washed twice using sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Fisher Chemicals, Leicestershire, UK). C. albicans and S. aureus were standardised to 106 cells\/ml in 50% foetal bovine serum (FBS). 50% FBS with no inoculum was used as a control. 1 ml of each of the individual cultures, mixed-cultures and controls were added to individual wells on a 24-well plate (Costar 3524 well plate, Corning Incorporated, NY, USA) containing a sterile cell culture Thermanox cover slip (13 mm \u00d8, Thermo Fisher Scientific, NY, USA). The cultures were incubated aerobically at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. This experiment utilized six technical replicates for each condition.","Extraction: Extracellular-metabolite extraction: Medium controls (50% FBS with MilliQ water) and biofilm supernatants were transferred into reaction tubes (1.5 ml, Greiner bio-one GmbH, Germany) containing ice cold chloroform:methanol:water (1:3:1 v:v:v) at a ratio of 1:40 (sample:extraction solvent). The reaction tubes were vortexed at maximum speed for 15 s (Vortex Genie 2, Scientific Industries, NY, USA) and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to derivatization and analysis. Intracellular-metabolite extraction: Cell culture cover slips were removed from the wells and placed in bijouxs containing ice cold 10 mM ammonium bicarbonate. The bijouxs were sonicated at maximum speed for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (XUB5, 4.5 L, Grant Instruments, Cambridgeshire, UK). The supernatants, including the debris, were removed and placed in clean reaction tubes. The biofilm suspensions were centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants were removed, and 1 ml of a 1 ml:1 g extraction solvent (ChCl3:MeOH:H2O 1:3:1 v:v:v) : 0.1 mm acid washed glass beads (Sigma Aldrich, USA) were added to each pellet. Bead beating was carried out at 3000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C (Disrupter Genie, Scientific Industries, NY, USA). The samples were centrifuged at 13000 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatants were removed and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to derivatization and analysis. Derivitization: Retention index mix was prepared from pure alkanes dissolved in hexane to a final concentration of 6 mg\/ml. Stock solutions were prepared for each from neat reference standard in water or HCl acidified water for amino acids insoluble in water alone. A custom standard mixture of sugars, sugar phosphates, pentose phosphates and amino acids were then prepared by mixing the stock solutions together and diluting with water. A volume of 30 \u00b5l extracted sample, as well as each standards mix of sugars, sugar phosphates, pentose phosphate pathway, and amino acids, were transferred into a 300 \u00b5l KIMSHIELD\u2122 deactivated glass polyspring insert (National Scientific). Internal standards 13C6-Glucose (2 nmol), D27-Myristic Acid (2 nmol) and Scyllo-Inositol (1 nmol) were added to each sample. Samples were then dried in a Savant SPD1010 SpeedVac concentrator (Thermo Scientific) for 90 min. Inserts were then placed into a 9 mm screw cap amber borosilicate glass 1.5 ml vial (Thermo Scientific). Fifty \u00b5l of 20 mg \/ ml (w\/v) methoxyamine HCl in pyridine was added to each dried sample and sealed. The vial and insert were vortexed for 10 s and incubated at 60 \u00b0C for 120 min. Following the methoximation step, 50 \u00b5l of MSTFA + 1% TMCS (N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide + 1% trimethylchlorosilane) was added, followed by a further 10 s of vortexing. Silylation was performed by incubation at 80 \u00b0C for a further 120 min. Samples were cooled to room temperature. 1 \u00b5l of retention index alkane mixture was added to each sample. Samples were then ready for injection.","Chromatography: The acquisition sequence started with six injections of matrix conditioning samples prior to running the biofilm and standards mix samples. Derivatized samples, reference standards mixes and QC samples were injected in randomised order across the batch, for a total of 57 injection runs. A robotic arm (Thermo Scientific\u2122 TriPlus\u2122 RSH autosampler ) injected 1 \u00b5l of derivatized sample into a split\/splitless (SSL) injector at 250 \u00b0C using a 1:100 split flow on a Thermo Scientific\u2122 TRACE\u2122 1310 GC. Helium carrier gas at a flow rate of 1.0 ml\/min was used for separation on a TraceGOLD TG-5SILMS 30 m length \u00d7 0.25 mm inner diameter \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness column (Thermo Scientific). The initial oven temperature was held at 70 \u00b0C for 4 min, followed by an initial gradient of 20 \u00b0C\/min ramp rate. The final temperature was 320 \u00b0C and held for 8 min.","Mass spec: Eluting peaks were transferred through an auxiliary transfer temperature of 250 \u00b0C into the Q Exactive-GC mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific). Electron ionisation (EI) at 70 eV energy, emission current of 50 \u00b5A with an ion source temperature of 230 \u00b0C was used in all experiments. A filament delay of 5.3 min was selected to prevent excess reagents from being ionised. High resolution EI fragment spectra were acquired using 60,000 resolution (FWHM at m\/z 200) with a mass range of 50-650 m\/z. The best internal lock mass from m\/z 207.0324, 281.0511 or 355.0699 was used to maintain mass accuracy within 1 ppm throughout the chromatogram.","Data transformation: Acquired data were processed using a targeted compound list based on the measured EI fragment from authentic standards. The exact mass of the most abundant fragment along with the measured retention time for each compound was entered into a compound database in TraceFinder 4.0 (Thermo Scientific, Runcorn, UK). Compound databases were verified using the standards mix chromatograms acquired during the batch. The data from the samples were then screened against the compound databases and the integrated area for each detected compound recorded. Peak areas were then normalised using total detected signal to compensate for differences in sample loading. The normalised areas were then log2 transformed and compared. PCAs were performed by importing the data into the Sieve 2.1 software","Metabolite id: Untargeted screening was performed using TraceFinder 4.0 for unknown compound discovery. This involved a peak deconvolution step using a peak threshold of 2,000.000 with m\/z signal-to-noise threshold of 20. NIST 2014 \u2018mainlib\u2019 and \u2018replib\u2019 low resolution libraries were used to annotate the peaks with a search index threshold of 500. Chemical formulae were then assigned to the accurate mass of each deconvoluted fragment ion measured from the Q Exactive GC making use of the molecular formula of the match to the NIST low resolution library hits. Deconvoluted samples are then retention time aligned and peaks grouped for comparison."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS370","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS370","title":"A novel targeted\/untargeted GC-Orbitrap metabolomics methodology applied to Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms","date":"2017-02-20","timestamp":1487548800,"submitter":["Stefan Weidt","Jennifer Haggarty","Cristian Cojocariu","Paul Silcock","Karl Burgess"],"publications":[{"title":"A novel targeted\/untargeted GC-Orbitrap metabolomics methodology applied to Candida albicans and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms","doi":"10.1007\/s11306-016-1134-2","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"QExactive GC (Thermo Scientific)","organism":["Bos taurus","Culture Media","Staphylococcus aureus","Candida albicans","NCBITAXON:Staphylococcus aureus; NCBITAXON:Candida albicans","Internal Standard","Standard"],"organism_parts":["fetal serum","media","culture supernatant","intracellular part","Chemical"]}},"MTBLS47":{"description":["Despite recent intensive research efforts in functional genomics, the functions of only a limited number of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) genes have been determined experimentally. Thus, improving gene annotation remains a major challenge in plant science. Because metabolite profiling can characterize the metabolomic phenotype of a genetic perturbation of plant metabolism, it provides clues to the function of genes of interest. In this regard, we chose 50 Arabidopsis mutants including a set of characterized and uncharacterized mutants, which resemble wild-type plants. We performed metabolite profiling of the plants using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). To make the dataset available as an efficient public functional genomics tool for hypothesis generation, we developed the MeKO database, which allows evaluation of whether a mutation affects metabolism during normal growth. This database contains images of mutants, statistical data analyses, and data on differential metabolite accumulation. Non-processed data, including chromatograms, mass spectra, and experimental meta-data, follow the guidelines of the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) and are freely downloadable. Proof-of-concept analysis suggests that the MeKO database is highly useful for gene annotation and for generation of hypotheses for genes of interest. MeKO is publicly available at http:\/\/prime.psc.riken.jp\/meko\/.","Sample collection: As described in [1], sterilized seeds were stratified at 5 \u00b0C for 2 d, and were successively sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers at 22 \u00b0C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 18 d. The aerial regions were harvested with 20 different biological replicates, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase. All plant materials were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen to quench enzymatic activity. Harvested samples with a fresh weight (FW) over 7 mg were used for GC-MS-based metabolite profiling.

Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments. Here, we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolite profilings of complete shoots (pooling leaves, petioles and stems) to compare the extremophile Lotus creticus, adapted to highly saline coastal regions, and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species, Lotus corniculatus and Lotus tenuis. L. creticus exhibited better survival after exposure to long-term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl- from the shoots than the glycophytes. In contrast, Na+ levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress, a trait often observed in halophytes. Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure. Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L. creticus shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes, providing little evidence for metabolic pre-adaptation to salinity. This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non-extremophile legumes, and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre-adaptation hypothesis.","Sample collection: L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain).

This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples. Ref: [1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 \u00b0C and matches ion source conditions.

However, novel risk predictors present opportunities to identify more patients at risk and to more accurately define the biochemical signature of that risk. In this paper, we present a comprehensive metabonomic analysis of 864 plasma samples from healthy volunteers, through Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and multivariate statistical analysis (regression and classification). We have found that subjects that are classified as at high or at low risk using the common clinical markers can also be discriminated using NMR metabonomics. This discrimination is not only due to common markers (such as total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HDL), but also to (p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) other metabolites (e.g., 3-hydroxybutyrate, \u03b1-ketoglutarate, threonine, dimethylglycine) previously not associated with cardiovascular diseases.","Sample collection: The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal.

PEPA detects the position of carbon label in isotopically enriched metabolites and quantifies fractional enrichment by indirect determination of 13C-satellite peaks using 1D-1H-NMR spectra. In comparison with 13C-NMR, TOCSY and HSQC, PEPA improves sensitivity, accelerates the elucidation of 13C positions in labeled metabolites and the quantification of the percentage of stable isotope enrichment. Altogether, PEPA provides a novel framework for extending the high-throughput of 1H-NMR metabolic profiling to stable isotope tracing in metabolomics, facilitating and complementing the information derived from 2D-NMR experiments and expanding the range of isotopically enriched metabolites detected in cellular extracts.

Precipitates were removed by centrifugation (12,000 x g) for 5 min, and 550 \u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes.","Nmr spec: 1H NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker AV500 NMR spectrometer operating at a 1H frequency of 500.13 MHz and equipped with a 5 mm self-shielded z-gradient triple resonance probe and a B-ACS 60 sample changer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany).","Nmr assay: For each plasma sample two types of proton (1H) NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K. (i) 1D NOESY spectra were acquired with the noesypr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). The water signal was suppressed by continuous wave irradiation during both the relaxation delay of 2.3 s and the mixing time (tm) of 100 ms. (ii) Water-suppressed Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meibom\u2013Gill (CPMG) spectra were acquired with the cpmgpr1d pulse sequence (Bruker Biospin pulse program library). A fixed spin-spin relaxation delay 2 nt of 60 ms duration (t = 500 \u00b5s) was used to eliminate the broad signals from high molecular weight analytes, and water suppression irradiation was applied during the relaxation delay of 2.3 s. For both types of spectra, 256 transients were collected into 32,768 data points using a spectral width of 20.0 ppm. All spectra were processed using TOPSPIN version 2.1 (Bruker Biospin). The free induction delays (FIDs) were multiplied by an exponential window function corresponding to 0.3 Hz line broadening factor before Fourier transformation. The acquired spectra were manually phased and baseline corrected. The spectra of plasma samples were referenced to the anomeric proton of glucose (d = 5.233 ppm).","Data transformation: 1H NMR spectra were automatically data-reduced to consecutive integral regions of equal width of 0.01 ppm (\u201cbuckets\u201d), covering the range of d = 9.0-0.5 ppm, using AMIX (Analysis of Mixtures software package, version 3.6.6, Bruker Biospin). The chemical shift regions at d 6.00-5.60 ppm and d 5.20-4.68 ppm were excluded from the plasma spectra to eliminate artifacts of the urea signal and of imperfect water suppression. The regions at d 3.63-3.60 ppm, 3.23-3.20 ppm, 3.15-3.07 ppm, 2.70-2.68 ppm, and 2.58-2.53 ppm, which contained EDTA signals, were also excluded to avoid these signals affecting the multivariate statistical analysis. For each spectrum, the resulting integral regions were normalized to the total intensity of the spectrum to correct for inter-sample differences in dilution. Subsequently, the bucketed data matrices were imported into the SIMCA-P+12.0 software package (Umetrics AB, Ume\u00e5, Sweden) for multivariate statistical analysis.","Metabolite id: The assignment of peaks to specific metabolites was based on the online databases Human Metabolome Database and Biological Magnetic Resonance Bank.

We here report non-targeted metabolome of human blood that is made up of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), using liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Previously, metabolome of a microbe, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was reported. Two sets of metabolome results are highly similar in their compositions: among 133 compounds identified in human blood, 101 (75%) are also present in S. pombe, and among 57 compounds enriched in RBC, 45 (78%) are also present in S. pombe. Most abundant metabolites are ATP, glutathione and glutamine. Many of other relatively abundant metabolites identified are also implicated in energy, anti-oxidant and amino acid metabolism. We show fourteen newly-identified blood compounds; citramalate, GDP-glucose, trimethyl-histidine, trimethyl-phenylalanine, trimethyl-tryptophan, trimethyl-tyrosine, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, UDP-glucuronate, dimethyl-lysine, glutamate methyl ester, N-acetyl-(iso)leucine, N-acetyl-glutamate, N2-acetyl-lysine, and N6-acetyl-lysine (the first eight are enriched in RBC). Ten of them are also detected in S. pombe, and ten of them are methylated or acetylated, amino acids. Trimethylated or acetylated free amino acids are also abundant in white blood cell. Their physiologic role may be investigated in the future by yeast genetics.","Sample collection: Human Blood: Three healthy male and one female volunteers (23\u201333 years old) participated in this study. Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were taken in the morning and subjects were asked not to eat breakfast to ensure at least 12 h of fasting prior to sampling. Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were drawn by venipuncture into 5 ml heparinized tubes (Terumo). Immediately, 0.2 ml blood samples were quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at -40 \u00b0C. The remainder of each blood sample was centrifuged at 120 x g for 15 min at room temperature to separate plasma and Red Blood Cells. After centrifugation, 0.2 ml of separated plasma and RBCs, respectively, was quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at -40 \u00b0C. Human White Blood Cells: For isolation of leucocytes we employed Ficoll gradient centrifugation. Blood of two donors, 20 ml each, was collected into heparinized tubes (Terumo) and subsequently diluted with the same volume of PBS buffer. Diluted blood was carefully layered onto the same volume of Lympholyte-H (Cosmo Bio, Tokyo, Japan) and centrifuged at room temperature for 20 min at 800 x g. Fission yeast: The wild-type heterothallic haploid 972 h-S. pombe strain was used for metabolomic experiments. Cells were cultivated at 26 \u00b0C in minimal synthetic medium EMM2 with 0.1% glucose (5.6 mM) content. Limited glucose media were prepared by mixing regular EMM2 (2% glucose) medium with EMM2-G (0% glucose) in an appropriate ratio.","Extraction: Human Blood: Ten nmol each of HEPES (4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid) and PIPES (piperazine-N,N'-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid)) was added to each sample to serve as standards. After brief vortexing, the samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins and cell debris. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was re-suspended in 40 \u00b5l of 50% acetonitrile and 1 \u00b5l (equivalent to 5 \u00b5l of initial sample) was used for each injection into the LC-MS system. Human White Blood Cells: Separated leucocytes were washed 3x in PBS (1 min, 350 x g, 4 \u00b0C). After dilution, 0.2 ml of leucocytes was quenched in 1.8 ml of 55% methanol at -40 \u00b0C. After the addition of HEPES and PIPES, samples were processed as described above. Metabolites were isolated from 10 \u00b5l of leukocyte cell volume. One \u00b5l of the metabolome sample was injected into the LC-MS system, corresponding to ~0.25 \u00b5l of leukocyte intracellular volume. Fission yeast: Preparation of fission yeast samples was done as described previously [1]. Briefly, fission yeast cells from 40 ml of culture were collected by vacuum filtration. Metabolites were isolated from 30 \u00b5l of total S. pombe cell volume. LC-MS sample injections (1 \u00b5L) corresponded to ~0.75 \u00b5l of S. pombe intracellular volume.

The fruits were collected in the ripe stage (when the berry is easily detached from the crown). DR samples were collected in Julius K\u00fchn Institute (Dresden, Germany), VG samples were collected from the the Berries Germplasm Collection of FEM, in Pergine Valsugana (TN, Italy), BP samples were collected from the company Berry Plant (Verona, Italy). Samples were collected in different years. All samples collected in 2010 were stored in cooled containers and transported to FEM laboratories where they were flash frozen and stored. Samples collected in Dresden were frozen in dry ice and transported to FEM. All other samples were flash frozen with liquid nitrogen immediately after collection and trasnported in dry ice to FEM.","Extraction: Small portions of each of the raspberry samples analysed were mixed to prepare a quality control sample (QC). For each sample and QC, the extraction was made as follows: 11.5 to 12.5 g of frozen raspberry was weighed in plastic 50 ml tubes, followed by addition of 150 mg internal standard (3,5-hidroxybenzoic acid) and 10 ml of 70% acetone to each tube. Samples were homogeneized with an IKA Ultraturrax disperser (Staufen, Germany) at a speed of 18 for 1.5 min. 10 ml of 70% acetone was used to help wash and collect all the sample from the homogenizer. The sample was allowed to extract for 20 min, after which it was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 rcf. The supernatant was collected into a 100 ml round bottom flask, filtering through glass wool to help collect any solid residues. Further 20 ml of 70% acetone was added to the pellet, vortexed vigorously to help homogeneization and centrifuged as before. The second (clear) supernatant was combined with the first one. After washing the funnel and glass wool with 5 ml of 70% acetone, the acetone was removed by rotary evaporation at 40 \u00b0C. The concentrated extract was transfered to a 20 ml volumetric flask and brought to volume with 5% methanol. 480 \u00b5l of each extract was transfered to an eppendorf containing 20 \u00b5l of 4-hidroxystilbene (5.6 g\/l), filtered through 0.2 \u00b5M PTFE filters into 2 ml amber (LC-MS certificated) vials, and stored at 4 \u00baC until the time of analysis.

The instrument was controlled by the MassLynx 4.1 software provided. The solvents used were water (A) and methanol (B), both with 0.1% formic acid, at a flow rate of 0.3 ml\/min. The gradient started at 100% A, kept for 6 min. The percentage of B increased to 100% over 50 min and maintained at that percentage for further 4 min. The system was returned to initial conditions and allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. Injection volume was 5 \u00b5l and samples were kept at 4 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: Detection was made on a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS, equiped with electrospray ionization (ESI) source, all from Waters (Manchester, UK). The instrument was controlled by the MassLynx 4.1 software provided. Data was collected in negative ion mode from 50 to 3000 m\/z, from two different acquisition channels (high and low energy). The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V for the low energy channel and 30 V and 6 V for the high energy. The analyser was set in W Mode. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 2.5 kV, Sampling Cone 25 V, Extraction Cone 3.0 V, Source Temperature 150 \u00b0C, Desolvation Temperature 500 \u00b0C, Cone Gas Flow 50 l\/hr, Desolvation Gas Flow 1000 l\/hr.

Both the trials were run by the International Breast Cancer Research Foundation. In the adjuvant trial, 740 premenopausal women with stage II-IIIB hormone receptor (HR)-positive breast cancer received surgical oophorectomy at the time of breast cancer surgery (mastectomy), followed by tamoxifen for 5 years, to investigate the hypothesis that surgery performed during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle would be associated with better outcomes. At the time of enrollment, 231 patients were estimated to be in the luteal phase and were scheduled for immediate surgery; 509 patients were estimated not to be in the luteal phase and were randomized to receive either immediate surgery or surgery scheduled to occur in the predicted mid-luteal phase [1]. Blood samples were collected preoperatively in fasted patients on the day of surgery. Frozen sera were initially stored at local sites and then shipped frozen to the United States. Subsequently specimens were shipped still frozen to Italy. No patients were recorded as diabetic.

Aside from the obvious depletion or elimination of urea, the effect, if any, of urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome has not been studied in detail. Here, we report the results of three separate but related experiments that were designed to assess possible indirect effects of urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome as measured by GC\u2013MS. In total, 235 GC\u2013MS analyses were performed and over 106 identified and 200 unidentified metabolites were quantified across the three experiments.

Overall, we observed no negative consequences of urease pre-treatment.

Metabolites were then extracted with concomitant protein precipitation by addition of 1 ml of cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol with vortexing for 30 s, and precipitated proteins were removed by centrifugation at 15,000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatants were transferred to glass autosampler vials and then dried in vacuo prior to chemical derivatization. If the extracts could not be immediately derivatized and analyzed by GC\u2013MS, then they were stored at -80 \u00b0C. Experiment 2: varying urine volumes To evaluate whether the effects of urease pre-treatment of urine varied with the volume of urine prepared, we compared the urine metabolite profiles from pooled urine after pre-treatment with urease (UT) and after no treatment (NT) using various volumes of urine. For this, several volumes (5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 \u00b5l) of the pooled urine sample were incubated (n = 3, each) with 100 \u00b5l of a 1 mg\/ml solution of urease or were not subjected to any treatment, each as described above. Metabolites were then extracted as described above. Experiment 3: male versus female urines Finally, to evaluate whether any artifacts introduced by urease pre-treatment on the urinary metabolome interfered with the ability to distinguish between comparative samples, we compared the metabolite profiles from individual male and female urine samples after pre-treatment with urease or after no treatment (previous metabolomics studies of male and female urines [1][2][3][4] have reported differences in metabolite levels). For this, 50 \u00b5L aliquots of individual male and female urine samples (n = 20, each) were blocked, randomized, and then incubated with 50 \u00b5l of a 1 mg\/ml solution of urease (UT) or were not subjected to any treatment (NT), each as described above. Metabolites were then extracted as described above. Creatinine was quantified in each sample using the DetectX Urinary Creatinine Detection Kit according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions, with the exception that a simple linear regression was used for the standard curve. Chemical derivatization: Dried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized using a modified version of the protocol used to create FiehnLib [5]. Briefly, dried metabolite extracts were dried again to remove any residual water if they had been stored at -80 \u00b0C. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg\/ml) were added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with generous shaking (1,000 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, the sample vials were inverted one time to capture any condensation of solvent at the cap surface, followed by a brief centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 1 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were then added to each vial, followed by vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (1,000 rpm) for 30 min. Again, the sample vials were inverted one time, followed by centrifugation at 1,000 x g for 5 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed in the same day. For Experiment 1, the derivatized samples were split into 3 portions and transferred to 3 new autosampler vials with inserts. For Experiment 2, the derivatized samples were kept intact and each transferred to a single new autosampler vial with insert. For Experiment 3, the derivatized samples were split into 2 portions and transferred to 2 new autosampler vials with inserts. Ref: [1] Pasikanti, K. K., Ho, P. C., & Chan, E. C. (2008).

A HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used for untargeted metabolomics analyses. The sample injection mode was splitless, and 1 \u00b5l of each sample was injected. The injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 \u00b0C [2].

Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices (RI) of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution.

PMID:19358599 ","Metabolite id: Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib [1] (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. We propose that this approach results in a metabolite identification confidence of Level 1.5, according to the guidelines recommended by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative Chemical Analysis Working Group of the Metabolomics Society [2]. While the library used to identify metabolites was generated by an external laboratory, this library contains both retention indices and mass spectra from analyses of authentic chemical standards, and our analyses were performed using methods identical to those used to create the library. The NIST 08 GC\u2013MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites (Level 2 identifications). The three most abundant fragment ions in the spectra of each identified metabolite were automatically determined by Metabolite Detector, and their summed abundances were integrated across the GC elution profile; fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m\/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance. A matrix of identified metabolites, unidentified metabolite features (characterized by mass spectra and retention indices and assigned as \u2018unknown\u2019; Level 4 identifications), and their abundances was created for each Experiment for statistical analysis. Features resulting from GC column bleeding were removed from the data matrices prior to further data processing and analysis.

Although genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analyses have been performed to investigate the pathogenesis of psoriasis, the role of metabolites in psoriasis, particularly of lipids, remains unclear. Lipids not only comprise the bulk of the cellular membrane bilayers but also regulate a variety of biological processes, such as cell proliferation, apoptosis, immunity, angiogenesis and inflammation. In this study, an untargeted lipidomics approach was used to study the lipid profiles in psoriasis and identify lipid metabolite signatures for psoriasis through ultra-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole tandem mass spectrometry. Plasma samples from 90 participants (45 healthy and 45 psoriasis patients) were collected and detected. Statistical analysis was applied to find different features between the disease and control groups. In addition, ELISA was performed to examine differentially-expressed lipids in psoriatic patient plasma. We finally identified several differential expression lipids including LPAs, LysoPCs, PIs, PCs and PAs, among these metabolites, LPAs, LysoPCs and PAs were significantly increased, while PCs and PIs were down-regulated in psoriasis group. We found that elements of the glycerophospholipid metabolism, such as LPAs, LysoPCs, PAs, PIs, and PCs, were significantly altered in the plasma of psoriatic patients. This investigation characterizes the circulating lipids in psoriatic patients and provides novel insights into the pathogenesis of psoriasis.","Sample collection: Healthy controls (n=45) and patients with mild or severe psoriasis (n=45) were recruited at the Xiangya Hospital Central South University in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All sample donors provided signed consent forms, which were approved by the Xiangya Hospital Committee of Ethics. Mild and moderate-severe psoriasis patients (defined as having a psoriasis area and severity index (PASI)>10) were recruited from a cohort of patients with new-onset psoriasis who did not require systemic therapy and were therefore only treated topically. None of the patients were on prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs. All samples were obtained prior to the commencement of any treatment. The recruited participants consisted of 90 gender-balanced individuals (45 healthy controls and 20 mild and 25 moderate-severe psoriasis patients). For analysis purposes, the full cohort (n=90) was subdivided into two gender- and disease groups (n=45 each), referred to as the exploratory and validation cohorts (Table 1 of associated paper [1]). After fasting overnight, 10 ml of whole blood was collected from each subject into EDTA tubes. Samples were left standing for 1 h before centrifugation at room temperature for 20 min at 3100 rpm. After centrifugation, plasma samples were collected and immediately stored at -80 \u00b0C until use. Psoriasis was judged as severe when it required systemic therapy and according to the PASI, which is an established measurement that quantifies the thickness, redness, scaling, and distribution of psoriasis lesions.

A flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min was used. The initial elution was set at 40% B and was immediately increased by a linear gradient to 43% B for the first 2 min, followed by an increase to 50% B within 0.1 min.

In the final part of the gradient, B was increased to 99% and maintained for 1.9 min. Finally, B was returned to 40% over the next 0.1 min and equilibrated for 1.9 min for the next injection","Mass spec: Both positive and negative modes were performed, and the scan range was 50\u20131,800 Da operated in Centroid MSE mode with an acquisition time of 0.2 s per scan. Nitrogen was used as the collision gas. For the positive ion mode, the capillary and sampling cone voltages were set at 0.25 kV and 40 V, respectively. For the negative ion mode, the capillary and sampling cone voltages were set at 2 kV and 40 V, respectively. The source temperature was set to 120 \u00b0C.

Leucine enkephalin (MW=555.62) (200 pg\/\u03bcl in ACN:H2O, 50:50) was applied as a lock mass for accurate mass measurements, and a 0.5 mM sodium formate solution was used for calibration. Furthermore, to evaluate the stability of the LC-MS throughout the acquisition, a QC sample was processed after every 10 samples.","Data transformation: The raw files were all imported into Progenesis QI (Waters, Nonlinear Dynamics, USA) software for peak alignment and peaking. Normalized data producted from Progenesis QI were further preprocessed by metaX software [1]. Feature was removed from the rest of the data analysis when it\u2019s detection is less 50% in QC samples or less 20% in experimental samples. Values missing were retained after the previous filtering and were inputed with the k-nearest neighbor method. Then, the Quality Control-Robust LOESS Signal Correction [2] and Combat normalization methods [3] were used to correct signal intensity draft and batch influence.

Ractopamine, a beta-agonist used as growth promoter in livestock, is with great controversy, and it has been forbidden in most countries worldwide. However, due to economic benefits, the possibility of widespread abuse of ractopamine still exists. \u201cOmics\u201d strategies, based on the observation of physiological perturbations, are promising approaches to tackle drug misuse in breeding animals. In this context, our aim was to set up a high performance liquid chromatography - high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) based metabolomics workflow for screening pig serum for ractopamine administration. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was developed to characterize and compare serum metabolic profiles from control and treated pigs. Two different extraction strategies were investigated, and the results showed that the combination of methanol extraction and methanol-water extraction protocols significantly improve the metabolites coverage. A two-level data analysis using univariate and multivariate statistical analyses was carried out to establish descriptive and predictive models, which enabled the discrimination of treated animals from control animals and highlighted a number of candidate biomarkers that contributed the most in the observed discrimination. This research indicates that metabolomics approach can be considered as a powerful strategy to highlight biomarkers related to ractopamine treatment in pig which may subsequently be implemented as screening strategy to predict for such illicit practices.","Sample collection: Ten 4 month-old female pigs (Axior Porc Charcutier) (Terrena, Ancenis, France) weighting 40 kg were randomly divided into control (n = 5 animals) and treated (n = 5 animals) groups. Animals were allowed a 3-day acclimatization period, following which, each animal received 1.8 kg feed\/day. Pigs from the treatment group received then on a daily basis and during 29 days, a feed containing ractopamine hydrochloride (Sigma Aldrich) (10 mg\/kg feed). The 10 ppm daily dose was selected as corresponding to classical doses used in finishing pigs. Blood samples were collected at day 3, 9, 16, 18, 23, 29, for both control and treated animals. The blood samples were allowed to clot at room temperature and the serum samples, obtained by centrifugation, were frozen and then stored at -80 \u00b0C. Prior to the extraction, serum samples were allowed to thaw on ice.","Extraction: In order to investigate and compare the global metabolomics profiles, two extraction strategies were used for sample preparation. Methanol extraction: This strategy is similar to the procedure published by[1]. 400 \u00b5l serum sample was extracted with 1400 \u00b5l MeOH containing 1 ng\/\u00b5l of each labeled internal standard. Then the mixture was vortexed for 20 s before centrifugation (2000 r\/min, 20 min, 4 \u00b0C). 370 \u00b5l supernatant was collected and then evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 \u00b0C, and subsequently reconstituted with 150 \u00b5l H2O before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis. Methanol\u2013water extraction: The extraction procedure firstly reported[2] and further re-adapted[3] was employed. The procedure consisted of a triphasic liquid\u2013liquid extraction with MeOH:CHCl3:H2O (1:2:0.63). 190 \u00b5l of MeOH was added to 30 \u00b5l serum sample and the mixture was vortexed for 20 s. Following this, 380 \u00b5l of CHCl3 was added and vortexed for 20 s. Finally, 120 \u00b5l of H2O was added to induce phase separation. The sample was further shaken for 10 s and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for 10 min before centrifugation (2000 r\/min, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C). 150 \u00b5l the upper phase (MeOH+H2O) was then collected and evaporated to dryness under gentle N2 at 30 \u00b0C, and subsequently reconstituted with 30 \u00b5l H2O containing 2 ng\/\u00b5l of each labeled internal standards before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis. QC sample preparation: A pooled quality control (QC) sample was prepared by pooling aliquots of all individual study samples. In our study, QC sample was extracted and processed according to the procedures described the above sections respectively. Then, these two reconstitution solutions were combined and mixed thoroughly before HPLC\u2013HRMS analysis. The QC solution is therefore representative of both extraction strategies tested. The same QC solution was injected at the beginning, the end, but also intervals of every 5 samples in each batch run to assure the analytical repeatability and the quality of the fingerprinting process throughout the study.

The chromatographic separation was achieved on a Hypersil Gold C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.9 \u00b5m particle size, Thermo Fisher Scientific) together with the corresponding guard column maintained at 35 \u00b0C, without splitting to the electrospray interface. The mobile phase consisted in water containing 0.1% acetic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% acetic acid (B). The used elution gradient (A:B, v\/v) was as follows: 95:5 from 0 to 2.40 min; 75:25 at 4.50 min; 30:70 at 11 min; 0:100 at 14\u201316.5 min; 95:5 at 19\u201325 min. The injected volume was 5 \u00b5l and the flow rate was 400 \u00b5l\/min.","Mass spec: A hybrid quadrupole-orbitrap (Q-Exactive\u2122) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) equipped with a heated electrospray (H-ESI II) source was operating in a polarity switching ion mode (positive\/negative). High resolution MS fingerprints were acquired using the following parameters: spray voltage \u00b13 kV; capillary temperature 350 \u00b0C; sheath gas flow rate 55 a.u. (arbitrary units), auxiliary gas flow rate 10 a.u., spare gas flow rate 0; max spray current \u00b1100 \u00b5A; probe heater temperature 300 \u00b0C; S-lens RF level 50. Full scan mass spectra were acquired from m\/z 65 to 975 at a mass resolving power of 70,000 Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) at m\/z 200. The scan speed was 2 Hz in profile mode. Daily instrument calibration was performed using a MSCAL6 ProteoMass LTQ\/FT-Hybrid. Xcalibur 2.2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) was used for data acquisition and analysis. In order not to bias statistical analyses or the metabolomics data structure, all the samples for analysis arising from control and treated animals, which were prepared separately by two extraction strategies, were randomized across the whole data acquisition sequence.","Data transformation: HPLC\u2013HESI (\u00b1) HRMS raw data files were initially preprocessed with Xcalibur 2.2. The raw (*.raw) files were subsequently converted to a more exchangeable format (*.mzXML) and polarity split using MSConvert[1]. Further data processing was performed using XCMS[2] software implemented with the R statistical language; multiple steps including: peak alignment, peak picking, retention time alignment followed by a peak grouping and integration step. The resulting XCMS matrix containing MS features for each sample, was subsequently exported to Excel\u00ae for univariate analysis, interbatch normalization and later to SIMCA-P+\u00ae (Version 13, Umetrics AB, Sweden) software for multivariate statistical analysis. The inter-batch instrumental drift may be confused with biological differences if it is not minimized. Therefore, after data processing, the removal of between-batch offsets and drifts was carried out by following the previously described procedure[3], assuming that the measurement errors in a single batch are randomly distributed, and that different batches can be compared and corrected using the average or median value of the QC samples in a batch.

An in-house Excel\u00ae Macro file was used to improve the annotation of the metabolic fingerprints automatically.

Increasingly large-scale metabolomics studies are being conducted, necessitating improvements in both bioanalytical and computational workflows to maintain data quality. This dataset represents a systematic evaluation of the reproducibility of a multi-batch DIMS metabolomics study of cardiac tissue extracts. It comprises of twenty biological samples (cow vs. sheep) that were analysed repeatedly, in 8 batches across 7 days, together with a concurrent set of quality control (QC) samples. Data are presented from each step of the workflow and are available in MetaboLights. The strength of the dataset is that intra- and inter-batch variation can be corrected using QC spectra and the quality of this correction assessed independently using the repeatedly-measured biological samples. Originally designed to test the efficacy of a batch-correction algorithm, it will enable others to evaluate novel data processing algorithms. Furthermore, this dataset serves as a benchmark for DIMS metabolomics, derived using best-practice workflows and rigorous quality assessment.","Sample collection: Fresh sheep (Ovis aries; n=10) and cow (Bos primigenius taurus; n=10) heart tissue was obtained from a local abattoir less than 4 miles away, packed on ice and driven back to the laboratory where it was frozen in liquid nitrogen. Portions of heart tissue were dissected and weighed (52 mg \u00b1 2.6 mg) before storing at -80 \u00b0C until extraction. Since the purpose of the study was to assess the analytical reproducibility of a DIMS metabolomics study, no data was collected on the sex, breed or origin of the tissue supplied.","Extraction: Low molecular weight metabolites were extracted from each cardiac tissue using a methanol \/ chloroform \/ water solvent system (final solvent ratio 2:2:1.8) as described previously [1]. Briefly, pre-weighed frozen tissue was homogenised in 8 ml\/g of ice-cold methanol and 2.5 ml\/g of ice-cold water in Precellys homogenisation tubes containing ceramic beads. The homogenate was transferred to 1.8 ml glass vials to which 8 ml\/g chloroform and 4 ml\/g water were added. Samples were vortexed and placed on ice for 10 mins before the biphasic mixture was centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 mins. After 5 mins at room temperature, ten 15 \u00b5l aliquots of the polar layer were transferred into ten 1.8 ml glass vials, dried in a centrifugal evaporator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY) and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Further tissue from the same anatomical region of the same twenty hearts was extracted as one pool and then aliquoted in 100 \u00b5l aliquots to make ten identical QC samples.

Samples were centrifuged at 15000-g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 mins to remove particulate matter. Metabolomic analyses were conducted in positive ion mode using a hybrid 7-T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a chip-based direct infusion nanoelectrospray ion source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions comprised of a 200 nl\/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and +1.7 kV electrospray voltage controlled by ChipSoft software (version 8.1.0). Mass spectrometry conditions included an automatic gain control setting of 1 x 106 and a mass resolution of 100,000 (at 400 m\/z). Analysis time was 2.25 minutes (per technical replicate), controlled using Xcalibur software (version 2.0, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Spectra were collected using the SIM stitching method, i.e. acquisition of seven overlapping selected ion monitoring (SIM) mass ranges between 70 and 590 Da in 100 Da windows, each with a 30 Da overlap with its neighbouring window [1]. This SIM stitching method has previously been shown to increase metabolome coverage compared to a traditional wide-scan approach, while providing high mass accuracy and a rapid sample throughput. For each replicate of each sample, data was collected as both proprietary-software-processed .RAW mass spectral files (Dataset 1: Instrument .RAW files) and as multiple individual transient files (i.e. signal intensity in the time domain).

Peaks were selected based on using a signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) threshold of 3.5:1, such that only peaks with a SNR value above this threshold were considered real, and retained in the dataset. Next, a calibration step was applied to convert the frequency domain to m\/z values and finally the seven individual SIM windows per replicate were combined \"stitched\" into one file comprising frequency, intensity, resolution and SNR of each peak . Three regions of electronic noise were removed (corresponding to m\/z 74.00 to 74.05, 90.44 to 90.49, and 101.7 to 101.9) and a maximum peak distance of 1.5 ppm was used for alignment of peaks.

This allowed for high intensity peaks of biological origin to be retained, even if there was a much lower intensity coincident contaminant peak. Next, 'sample filtering' was applied, which amalgamates the individual biological sample spectra into a data matrix according to this criteria: a peak must be present in at least 80% of the biological samples to be retained.

First, a peak was removed if the relative difference between the median QC sample intensity compared to the median biological sample intensity was inconsistent between batches. This phenomenon is indicative of a failure to detect that peak in the QC samples, within one or more batches (tested using non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test for comparison of batch medians, after signal correction, with a critical p-value of 0.0001). As such the peak as a whole must be considered unreliable and removed. In the second spectral cleaning algorithm, a peak was removed if the difference between the median QC sample intensity and the median biological sample intensity was relatively large (tested using non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, with critical p-value set empirically to 1x10-14). This phenomenon indicates that the QC samples are not in fact representative of the average of the biological samples, perhaps due to degradation. Finally, a peak was removed if its RSDQC value was >20%; i.e. the analytical reproducibility of the peak was considered too high. Ref: [1] Kirwan JA, Broadhurst DI, Davidson RL, Viant MR.

We investigated the cell division-quiescence behavior of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe under a wide range of glucose concentrations (0-111 mM). The mode of S. pombe cell division under a microfluidic perfusion system was surprisingly normal under highly diluted glucose concentrations (5.6 mM, 1\/20 of the standard medium, within human blood sugar levels). Division became stochastic, accompanied by a curious division-timing inheritance, in 2.2-4.4 mM glucose. A critical transition from division to quiescence occurred within a narrow range of concentrations (2.2-1.7 mM). Under starvation (1.1 mM) conditions, cells were mostly quiescent and only a small population of cells divided. Under fasting (0 mM) conditions, division was immediately arrested with a short chronological lifespan (16 h). When cells were first glucose starved prior to fasting, they possessed a substantially extended lifespan (\u223c14 days). We employed a quantitative metabolomic approach for S. pombe cell extracts, and identified specific metabolites (e.g. biotin, trehalose, ergothioneine, S-adenosyl methionine and CDP-choline), which increased or decreased at different glucose concentrations, whereas nucleotide triphosphates, such as ATP, maintained high concentrations even under starvation. Under starvation, the level of S-adenosyl methionine increased sharply, accompanied by an increase in methylated amino acids and nucleotides. Under fasting, cells rapidly lost antioxidant and energy compounds, such as glutathione and ATP, but, in fasting cells after starvation, these and other metabolites ensuring longevity remained abundant. Glucose-starved cells became resistant to 40 mM H(2)O(2) as a result of the accumulation of antioxidant compounds.","Sample collection: The wild-type heterothallic haploid 972 h-S. pombe strain was used for the metabolomic experiments. Cells were cultivated in minimal synthetic medium EMM2 with modified glucose content. Limited glucose media were prepared by mixing regular EMM2 (2% glucose) medium with EMM2-G (0% glucose) in the appropriate ratio. The cultivation temperature was 26 \u00b0C unless otherwise stated.","Extraction: Cells from cultures (40 ml per sample, 5 x 10^6 cells\/ml) were collected by vacuum filtration and immediately quenched in \u201340 \u00b0C methanol. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and constant amounts of internal standards (10 nmol of HEPES and PIPES) were added to each sample. Cells were disrupted using a Multi-Beads Shocker (Yasui Kikai, Osaka, Japan) in 500 \u00b5l of 50% methanol. Proteins were removed by filtering on an Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and samples were concentrated by vacuum evaporation. Finally, each sample was resuspended in 20 \u00b5l of 50% acetonitrile and 1 \u00b5l was used for autosampler injection.","Chromatography: Each sample was prepared 3 times. LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). LC separation was performed on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Ume\u00e5, Sweden; 150 mm x 2.1 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size). Acetonitrile (A) and 10 mm ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) were used as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 \u00b5l\/min.","Mass spec: LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used. For MS detection, an electrospray ionization (ESI) source was used. Each sample was injected twice (1 \u00b5l volume\/injection), once with the ESI operated in negative ionization mode and once in positive ionization mode. Spray voltage was set to 2.8 kV (negative ESI) or 4 kV (positive ESI) and capillary temperature to 350 \u00b0C or 300 \u00b0C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas. The mass spectrometer was operated in a full scan mode with a 100\u20131000 m\/z scan range and automatic data-dependent MS\/MS fragmentation scans.","Data transformation: Raw LC-MS data were analyzed by the MZmine 2 software.","Metabolite id: Metabolites were identified by comparing their m\/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS316","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS316","title":"Specific biomarkers for stochastic division patterns and starvation-induced quiescence under limited glucose levels in fission yeast","date":"2017-07-06","timestamp":1499295600,"submitter":["Tom\u00e1\u0161 Pluskal","Takeshi Hayashi","Shigeaki Saitoh","Asuka Fujisawa","Mitsuhiro Yanagida"],"publications":[{"title":"Specific biomarkers for stochastic division patterns and starvation-induced quiescence under limited glucose levels in fission yeast","doi":"10.1111\/j.1742-4658.2011.08050.x","pubmed":"PMID:21306563"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"LTQ Orbitrap Classic (Thermo Scientific)","organism":"Schizosaccharomyces pombe","organism_parts":"whole organism","metabolites":["CTP","Fructose-1-6-diphosphate","Fructose-6-phosphate","GDP-glucose","Glucose-6-phosphate","Glutathione (GSH)","Glutathione (GSSG)","Glycerophosphoethanolamine","Glycerophosphoinositol","GTP","Inosine","Phosphoglyceric acid","Phosphoenolpyruvate","Trehalose","UDP-acetyl-glucosamine","UDP-glucose","UTP","Xanthosine"]}},"MTBLS103":{"description":["Hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess (HIAE) in prepubertal and pubertal girls usually precedes a broader pathological phenotype in adulthood that is associated with anovulatory infertility, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. The metabolic derangements that determine these long-term health risks remain to be clarified. Here we use NMR and MS-based metabolomics to show that serum levels of methionine sulfoxide in HIAE girls are an indicator of the degree of oxidation of methionine-148 residue in apolipoprotein-A1. Oxidation of apo-A1 in methionine-148, in turn, leads to an impaired maturation of high-density lipoproteins (HDL) that is reflected in a decline of large HDL particles. Notably, such metabolic alterations occur in the absence of impaired glucose tolerance, hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and were partially restored after 18 months of treatment with a low-dose combination of pioglitazone, metformin and flutamide.","Sample collection: The study population consisted of 12 non-obese adolescents (age, 16.3\u00b10.4 yr; BMI, 22.8\u00b10.5 kg\/m2) diagnosed with HIAE and 14 age-, weight- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Untargeted metabolomic analyses on serum samples of HIAE and control patients were performed using two analytical platforms: 1H-NMR and LC-ESI-QTOF. Each serum sample was split into two aliquots and run in parallel using the two analytical platforms.","Extraction: The second aliquot was used for LC-MS analysis. 30 \u00b5l of serum sample was mixed with 120 \u00b5l of cold ACN\/H2O (1:1) with 1% meta-phosphoric acid (MPA) and 0.1% formic acid (previously filtered). Samples were vortexed vigorously for 30 s and stored at \u201320 \u00b0C for 2 hr to enable protein precipitation. Subsequently, samples were centrifuged 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and 22600 RCF and the supernatant was transferred to a LC-MS vial.","Sample collection: For the NMR measurement 250 \u00b5l of serum were mixed with 250 \u00b5l of phosphate buffer (0.75 mM Na2HPO4 adjusted at pH 7.4, and 20% D2O to provide the field frequency lock). The final solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube and kept refrigerated at 4 \u00b0C in the autosampler until the analysis.","Nmr spec: 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at 310 K on a Bruker Avance III 600 spectrometer operating at a proton frequency of 600.20 MHz using a 5 mm CPTCI triple resonance (1H, 13C, 31P).","Nmr assay: Two different 1H-NMR pulse experiments were performed for each sample: 1) Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY)-presaturation sequence to suppress the residual water peak; and 2) Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill sequence (CPMG, spin-spin T2 relaxation filter) with a total time filter of 410 ms to attenuate the signals of serum macro-molecules to a residual level; 20 ppm spectral width and a total of 64 transients collected into 64 k data points.","Chromatography: Samples were injected in a UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a quadrupole time of flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer (6550 Agilent Technologies) operated in positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. Metabolites were separated using either C18-RP (ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 1.8 \u00b5m, Waters) or HILIC (ACQUITY UPLC BEH 1.7 \u00b5m, Waters) chromatography at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min. The solvent system in C18-RP was A=0.1% formic in water, and B=0.1% formic in acetonitrile. The linear gradient elution started at 100% A (time 0-3 min) and finished at 100% B (20\u201321 min). The solvent system in HILIC was A=50mM NH4OAc in water, and B=ACN. The linear gradient elution started at 95% B (time 0\u20132 min) and finished at 55% B (6 min).","Mass spec: The injection volume was 2 \u00b5l. ESI conditions were gas temperature, 225 \u00b0C; drying gas, 13 l\/min; nebulizer, 20 psig; fragmentor, 125 V; and skimmer, 65 V. The instrument was set to acquire over the m\/z range 80-1200 with an acquisition rate of 4 spectra\/s. Quality control samples (QC) consisting of pooled serum samples of all patients were used. QC samples were injected before the first study sample and then periodically after five-study samples. Furthermore, real samples were randomized to reduce systematic error associated with instrumental drift. MS\/MS was performed in targeted mode, and the instrument was set to acquire over the m\/z range 50-1000, with a default iso width (the width half-maximum of the quadrupole mass bandpass used during MS\/MS precursor isolation) of 4 m\/z. The collision energy was fixed at 20 V. With the exception of glutamyl taurine and glutamyl glycine, all metabolites were identified conforming to Level 1 as specified by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative[1], that is, by comparison with accurate mass, retention time and MS\/MS data of chemical standards analysed in our laboratory with the same analytical platform and method. Glutamyl taurine and glutamyl glycine conform Level 2 (i.e., putatively annotated compound) since we did not find the chemical standards. Still, their experimental MS\/MS spectra coincide with the expected fragmentation pattern of these dipeptides. Targeted metabolomics: Relevant metabolites were measured again using an UHPLC system (1290 Agilent) coupled to a triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS (6490 Agilent Technologies) operated in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) mode. MRM transitions were: methionine (150->56, 61), methionine sulfoxide (166->56, 74), taurine (126->41, 85), glutamate (148->56, 84), cysteine-glycine (179->59, 116), glutathione (308->76, 162), glutathione disulfide (613->355, 484), glutamate-glutamate (277->84, 130), glutamate-cysteine (251->84, 122), 5-oxoproline (130->56, 84).

After baseline correction, intensities of each 1H-NMR regions identified in the CPMG 1D-NMR spectra were integrated for each sample entering the study using the AMIX 3.8 software package (Bruker, GmBH). For the MS data, XCMS analysis of these data provided a matrix containing the retention time, m\/z value, and integrated peak area of greater than 38.000 features after the analytical variability had been corrected[1]. Only the integrated areas of those metabolite features above 5,000 spectral counts in at least one of the two groups were considered for quantification. The tab-separated text files containing LC-MS data were imported into Rstudio (version 3.0.2) where QC samples were used to filter analytical variation as previously described[1]. Univariate statistical analysis was performed using robust statistics (Yuen-Welch\u2019s t-test). Differentially regulated metabolites (fold>1.5) that passed our statistical criteria (p-value<0.01) were characterized by LC-qTOF MS\/MS and identified using the Metlin database and pure standards purchased on our lab.

Using targeted LC-MS and GC-MS platforms we quantified 229 and 29 metabolites, respectively in a time-course study to reveal short-term responses to different concentrations (1, 3, and 10 mM) of bicarbonate (HCO3-) under light and dark conditions. Results indicate that HCO3- treatment responsive metabolomic changes depend on the HCO3- concentration, time of treatment, and light\/dark. Interestingly, 3 mM HCO3- concentration treatment induced more significantly changed metabolites than either lower or higher concentrations used. Flavonoid biosynthesis and glutathione metabolism were common to both light and dark-mediated responses in addition to showing concentration-dependent changes.

For controls, NaNO3 (NO3- is a macronutrient in MS media) was added in same concentration to nullify the effect of Na+ during the treatment.

chemistry for 3D molecular analysis of a tissue specimen, entire organ, or microbial colonies on an agar plate. 3D imaging MS has unique advantages over existing 3D imaging techniques, offers novel perspectives for understanding the spatial organization of biological processes, and has growing potential to be introduced into routine use in both biology and medicine. Due to the sheer quantity of data generated, visualization, analysis, and interpretation of 3D imaging MS data remain a significant challenge. Bioinformatics research in this field is hampered by the lack of publicly available benchmark datasets needed for evaluation and comparison of algorithms. Findings We acquired high-quality 3D imaging MS datasets from different biological systems at several labs, supplied them with overview images and scripts demonstrating how to read them, and deposited them into MetaboLights, an open repository for metabolomics data. 3D imaging MS data was collected from five samples using two types of 3D imaging MS. 3D Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption\/Ionization (MALDI) imaging MS data was collected from murine pancreas, murine kidney, human oral squamous cell carcinoma, and interacting microbial colonies cultured in Petri dishes. 3D Desorption Electrospray Ionization (DESI) imaging MS data was collected from a human colorectal adenocarcinoma. Conclusions With the aim to stimulate computational research in the field of computational 3D imaging MS, we provided selected high-quality 3D imaging MS datasets which can be used by algorithm developers as benchmark datasets.","Sample collection: 3D imaging MS data were collected from five samples using two types of 3D imaging MS. 3D matrix-assisted laser desorption\/ionization imaging (MALDI) MS data were collected from murine pancreas, murine kidney, human oral squamous cell carcinoma, and interacting microbial colonies cultured in Petri dishes. 3D desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) imaging MS data were collected from a human colorectal adenocarcinoma.","Data transformation: A total of five 3D imaging MS datasets in the imzML format (an open and standard file format for imaging MS data) are provided. The imzML file structure consists of an XML-like file containing metadata (*.imzML) and a binary data file containing spectra (*.ibd); both are unequivocally linked by a universally unique identifier. In the imzML files provided here, the relative position of each voxel in the 3D space is stored in the \u201cuserParam\u201d field.The 3D DESI-imaging MS dataset is provided both in multiple imzML files each containing an 2D imaging MS dataset of an individual section and in a single HDF5 file containing the metadata, coregistered imaging MS data, and optical [haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained] images.","3d maldi imaging ms dataset of a mouse kidney: The dataset comprises 75 sections from the central part of a mouse kidney that was PAXgene\u00ae fixed and paraffin embedded. The matrix was applied using a vaporization sprayer (ImagePrep\u2122, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Spectra were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex speed\u2122 MALDI mass spectrometer in linear positive mode in the mass range of 2,000-20,000\u00a0m\/z\u00a0and a deflection of 1,500\u00a0m\/z. In total, the dataset comprised 1,362,830 spectra, each containing 7,680 data points. Each spectrum was acquired with 200 laser shots, and the random walk option was set to 20 shots per position. A medium-size laser focus was chosen, so as to be suitable for the selected lateral resolution of 50 \u03bcm pixel size. During the data acquisition, the spectra preprocessing included a Gaussian spectral smoothing with a width of 2 within 4 cycles as well as baseline reduction using the Top Hat algorithm. The data for all 75 sections were imported into the software SCiLS Lab (SCiLS, Bremen, Germany) version 2014b. The registration of individual sections was performed with the aim to reconstruct the original relations between the sections. For this purpose, the so-called user-guided rigid registration was used, and this was performed interactively as follows. First, the first of the consecutive sections was placed in the center of the software view. Then, each of the following sections was positioned over the previous image and moved in the\u00a0x- and\u00a0y-directions and rotated with the help of the interactive software (keyboard, mouse); the half-transparent overlap with the previous image helps evaluate the positioning. The method allows for compensation of rotations and translations. Finally, the dataset containing spectra with adjusted spatial coordinates\u00a0x\u00a0and\u00a0y\u00a0and newly assigned coordinate\u00a0z\u00a0was exported into the imzML format with files named 3DMouseKidney.ibd and 3DMouseKidney.imzML.","3d maldi imaging ms dataset of a mouse pancreas: The 3D mouse pancreas dataset was created in a similar fashion to the mouse kidney dataset. A C57BL\/6 mouse was sacrificed, and the pancreas was immediately isolated, fixed in PAXgene\u00ae Tissue Containers according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), dehydrated, and embedded in low-melting-point paraffin. Sections (5 \u03bcm in thickness) were cut on a microtome and mounted on indium-tin-coated conductive glass slides (Bruker Daltonics). After paraffin removal and washing, 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB), dissolved at 30 mg\/ml in 50% methanol with 0.2% TFA as a matrix, was used. Spectra from 29 consecutive sections were acquired using a Bruker Daltonics Autoflex speed\u2122 mass spectrometer in linear positive mode in the mass range 1,600-15,000\u00a0m\/z. A medium-size laser diameter was used, with a lateral resolution of 60 \u03bcm and 500 laser shots per pixel were accumulated with the random walk option set to 100 shots per position. The complete dataset with 29 sections comprised 497,225 spectra with 13,312 data points per spectrum. The unprocessed raw data were imported into the software SCiLS Lab, version 2014b. For 3D image registration in SCiLS Lab, a section thickness of 5 \u03bcm was selected. The image registration was performed as described earlier for the 3D mouse kidney. Data conversion into the imzML format was performed as described for the mouse kidney.","3d maldi imaging ms datasets of cultured microbial colonies in a time course experiment: For this dataset, metabolic exchange of the interacting microbes Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) and Bacillus subtilis PY79 was followed in a time-course experiment on the first, fourth, and eighth days after co-inoculation in a Petri dish. Culturing of the microbes and sample preparation for 3D MALDI imaging MS were performed. Briefly, equally sized agar slices were sectioned and mounted on a MALDI-TOF steel target. A universal matrix (a mixture of alpha-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid) was applied with a 50 \u03bcm pore size sieve, and the samples were allowed to dry completely. Spectra were acquired on an Autoflex\u2122 MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker) in linear positive mode in the mass range of 0\u20134,000 m\/z using a large laser diameter and 300 shots per spectrum. A lateral resolution of 400 \u03bcm was selected. All individual sections were imported into the software SCiLS Lab, version 2014b, for 3D volume generation. In total, the dataset comprised 17,672 spectra, and the bin size was reduced to 40,299 data points per spectrum during import. To construct a 3D volume that resembled the length, width, and height of the original agar block, a thickness of 1,500 \u03bcm per section producing voxels of 400\u2009\u00d7\u2009400\u2009\u00d7\u20091,500 \u03bcm was chosen. The 3D volume was built up, starting with the first section from the day 1 post-inoculation dataset. After completion of image registration from the first time point, a spacing of 10.5 mm was introduced, starting with the block from the time point day 4. The same steps were repeated for the block from time point day 8 after inoculation. Besides these additional steps, the image registration was performed as described earlier for the 3D mouse kidney dataset. The complete dataset was then exported into the imzML format to produce the files.","3d desi imaging ms dataset of a human colorectal adenocarcinoma: Sections from a single colorectal adenocarcinoma (n\u2009=\u200926) were analyzed by DESI-imaging MS. The tissue specimen was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in a freezer at \u221280\u00b0C prior to cryosectioning at 10 \u03bcm thickness using a Microm HM550 Cryostat (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Runcorn, UK) set at \u221216\u00b0C, and thaw mounted onto SuperFrost\u00ae Glass slides (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Distilled water was used to mount the sample to the sample holder, and the cryosectioning was performed without embedding medium. The built-in vacutome function of the cryostat was used to facilitate sectioning. The slides were stored in closed containers at \u221280\u00b0C prior to analysis and allowed to thaw at room temperature under nitrogen flow prior to DESI-imaging MS acquisition.Sections were cut to a step size of 10 \u03bcm, and every tenth section was imaged. Four sequential sections were deposited on each slide. The instrumental spatial resolution was set to 100 \u03bcm, and analysis of every tenth 10 \u03bcm section resulted in 100 \u03bcm3 voxels.Imaging MS data were acquired in the negative-ion mode over an m\/z range of 200\u20131,050 using a Thermo Exactive instrument (Thermo Scientific GmbH, Bremen, Germany) coupled to a home-built automated DESI-imaging source as described previously [Gerbig S, Golf O, Balog J, Denes J, Baranyai Z, Zarand A, et al.: Analysis of colorectal adenocarcinoma tissue by desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometric imaging. Anal Bioanal Chem 2012, 403:2315-25.]. The solvent used for DESI analysis was methanol\/water (95\/5 v\/v) at a flow rate of 1.5 ml\/min. Nitrogen was used as a nebulizing gas at a pressure of 7 bar. The distance between the DESI spray tip and the sample surface was set to 1.5 mm; the distance between the DESI spray tip and the mass spectrometer was set to 14 mm; and the distance between the inlet capillary and the sample surface was 0.1 mm. The spray angle was 80\u00b0, whereas the collection angle was fixed at 10\u00b0. The spray voltage used for analysis was 4.5 kV. Each row of pixels was acquired as a continuous line scan over the sample surface and saved in a separate raw file. All Thermo raw files of one imaging experiment were then converted to imzML format using the imzML converter v1.1.4.5i. The imzML files were named with reference to the section number and location of the section on the slide. For example, in the file named \u201c120TopL, 90TopR, 110BottomL, 100BottomR-centroid.imzML\u201d, the top-right section was the 90th section cut from the sample at a depth of 900 \u03bcm.","3d maldi imaging ms dataset of a human oral squamous cell carcinoma: A tissue specimen from a patient with an oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was obtained from the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Hospital Jena. The necessary approval was obtained from the local Ethics Committee, approval No. 3008-12\/10.3D MALDI imaging MS analysis was applied to 58 cryosections, each with a thickness of 10 \u03bcm. The sections were mounted on indium-tin-oxide-coated conductive glass slides (Bruker Daltonics) and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until use. After drying under vacuum for 15 min, the slides were washed twice for 2 min in 70% ethanol and thereafter for 2 min in 99% ethanol. The SA used as a matrix was applied using the Bruker ImagePrep\u2122 device. MALDI imaging MS was performed on an Autoflex speed\u2122 mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics) in linear positive mode. Spectra were acquired in the mass range 2,000-20,000 m\/z with a deflection set to 1,500 m\/z. Each spectrum was a sum of 200 laser shots, and the random walk option was set to 25 shots per position. A medium-size laser diameter was selected for the chosen lateral resolution of 60 \u03bcm. In total, the dataset comprised 828,558 spectra with 7,680 data points per spectrum. The spectra were preprocessed during acquisition applying Gaussian spectral smoothing with a width of 2 within 4 cycles as well as baseline reduction using the Top Hat algorithm. The data for all sections were imported into the software SCiLS Lab, version 2014b, and rigid image registration was performed by user-guided stacking of the optical images as described earlier for the 3D mouse kidney dataset. A slice thickness, or z-distance, of 60 \u03bcm was selected to produce voxels of 60 \u03bcm3.

It was introduced into the genome of two grape cultivars Thompson Seedless and Silcora (SIL) and both transgenic cultivars had an increased number of berries per bunch. This study investigates the down-stream metabolic changes of Silcora and Thompson seedless grape cultivars when genetically modified through the insertion of the DefH9-iaaM gene into their genome. The effect of the genetic modification upon the grape metabolome was evaluated by 1H-NMR and exploratory data analysis and chemometrics methods. Interval Partial Least Squares regression (iPLS) and metabolite heatmaps were employed for scrutinizing the changes in the transgenic metabolome as compared to the wild type metabolome. The result shows that the pleiotropic effects on the metabolome as a function of the gene modifications is relatively low, but that the insertion of transgene caused a decrement in the malic acid and proline and an increment in the p-coumaric acid concentration. The results further show that the concentration of malic acid was correlated with the number of inserted copies of transgene in Silcora cultivar, proving that the inserted genes, which catered for increased berry quality and production, are made on the expense of a greater decrement in malic acid concentration in the berries. NMR together with chemometrics is able to identify specific metabolites that were up- or down regulated in the genetically engineered plants, and thus able to highlight alterations in the down-stream metabolic pathways due to the up-stream genetic modifications.","Sample collection: NMR samples were prepared from the extracts of berries of Thompson Seedless THS-WT and of the DefH9-iaaM line (THS-GM1), and berries of Silcora SIL-WT and of the two DefH9-iaaM modified lines, SIL-GM1 and SIL-GM2. All berries were harvested in the same period (year 2007). At harvest, samples were freeze dried at -80\u00b0 and then shipped in dry ice at the laboratory of analyses.","Extraction: For each genotype (control and transgenic lines of both cultivars), a bulk of 100 \u00b1 1 g of berries was treated; both skin and pulps of each sample were homogenized under ice chilling and 3 aliquots of about 10.0 g were vortexed separately with 10.0 ml of a mixture of methanol and 50 mM CH3COOH\/Na+ buffer pH 5.0 (2:1) in order to perform the solvent extraction. The suspensions were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0 C. The resulting hydro-alcoholic solution was dispensed in different Eppendorf tubes, as 1 ml aliquots, and stored at -80\u00b0 C.","Sample collection: Before the NMR acquisition, 10% (v\/v) D2O was added to each 1 ml extract, thus centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. pH was not further adjusted, but it was measured for each sample yielding an average of 4.29 with a standard deviation of 0.08, confirming the buffer efficacy. A volume of 800 \u00b5l was transferred to a 5-mm NMR tube in order to acquire a single NMR FID (Free Induction Decay).","Nmr spec: The 1H-NMR spectra were recorded at T = 300K using a Varian Mercury AS\/400 NMR spectrometer operating at 9.4 T, corresponding to 400.098 MHz 1H Larmor frequency.","Nmr assay: For each spectrum 2048 scans were acquired, with data collected into 16K data points with a spectral width of 16 ppm, a pulse angle of 60\u00b0, a recycle delay of 1.0 s, and acquisition time of 2.561 s. The water and methanol singlets were suppressed using a standard Varian WET pre-saturation sequence, with simultaneous irradiation of both the water and the methanol frequencies. Prior to Fourier transformation, each FID was apodized by Lorentzian line broadening of 1 Hz.","Data transformation: Spectra were phase and baseline corrected manually using MestRe-C 4.9.8.0 (www.mestrec.com, Mestreab Research SL, Santiago de Compostela, Spain). The same software was used to export data in ASCII file format. Chemical shift referencing was performed by setting the glucose\u2019s \u00df-anomeric signal to 4.60 ppm. The following spectral regions were removed prior to data analysis: the regions including only noise (the spectrum edges between 14.05 and 8.7 ppm and between 0.4 and -1.93 ppm) and the NMR signals which are strongly affected by the residual solvent peak (water, between 5.15 and 4.65 ppm, methanol, between 3.28 and 3.41 ppm and acetic acid, between 1.97 and 2.18 ppm). As a result, the total number of spectral data points was reduced to 7585 points. A spectral dataset matrix with the dimensions 45 x 7585 was then constructed for subsequent multivariate data analysis.","Metabolite id: Molecular assignments was obtained through a combination of literature assignments [1]-[6], standard addition (spiking) and by the use of a multimedia library of pure compounds believed to be present in the extracts (http:\/\/www.bmrb.wisc.edu\/).

Here, we develop a high-throughput mass spectrometry approach to comprehensively profile proteome-scale protein collections for in vitro enzymatic activity. Overexpressed or purified proteins are incubated in a supplemented metabolome extract containing hundreds of biologically relevant candidate substrates, and accumulating or depleting metabolite ions are determined by nontargeted mass spectrometry. Combining chemometrics and database approaches, we established an automated pipeline for unbiased annotation of novel enzyme functions that was demonstrated to achieve 75% predictive accuracy. In a screen of all 1,275 functionally uncharacterized Escherichia coli proteins, this low false-positive rate discovery method identified 241 potential novel enzymes. Twelve of these were experimentally validated to catalyze 29 diverse metabolic reactions, including the long-elusive multispecific cytidine monophosphate nucleosidase PpnN (YgdH) and the two fumarases FumD (YdhZ) and FumE (YggD). Thus, we establish high-throughput nontargeted in vitro metabolomics and the corresponding hypothesis generation pipeline as an approach for proteome-scale enzyme discovery and assign enzymatic functions to about 20% of the so far uncharacterized E. coli proteins.","Sample collection: Media and bacterial cell cultivation: All E. coli strains used in this study were obtained from the ASKA collection[1].

After incubation at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min, lysis was completed by three repeated cycles of freezing (-80 \u00b0C) and thawing (30 \u00b0C). 50 \u03bcl aliquots of the cell lysates were stored at -80 \u00b0C for the cell lysate activity assays. Remaining cell lysates were applied to 96-well format Ni2+-charged nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity columns (GE Healthcare) and washed twice with 20 column volumes of washing buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5). Proteins were eluted from the column with elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) which was subsequently replaced by storage buffer (2 mM TrisHCl, 1 mM MgCl2, pH 7.4) using 96-well ultrafiltration plates with 10 kDa molecular weight cutoff, and proteins were stored at 4 \u00b0C at most 1 day before performing activity assays. We recorded for each purified protein the growth of its expression strain, the concentration of purified protein and whether the solution had a yellow color (see Supplementary Table 3). Four 96-well plates per workday can be easily handled in parallel, thus enabling a theoretical throughput of 384 purified proteins using this setup. Non-targeted enzyme activity assays: Each assay mixture contained 39 \u03bcl buffer (2 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM MgCl2, pH 7.5), 5 \u03bcl 10-fold concentrated cofactor mix (1 mM of each NADH, NAD+, NADPH, NADP+, FAD, ATP, GTP, ITP, S-adenosyl-L-methionine, acetyl-CoA, CoA), 2.5 \u03bcl of E. coli metabolite extract cultivated on glucose minimal medium and 2.5 \u03bcl of E. coli metabolite extract cultivated on glycerol complex medium per well in 96-well plates.

All steps of mass spectrometry data processing and analysis were performed with Matlab (The Mathworks, Natick) using functions embedded in the Bioinformatics, Statistics, Database, and Parallel Computing toolboxes as described previously[1]. Briefly, peak detection was done for each sample once on the total profile spectrum obtained by summing all single scans recorded over time and using wavelet decomposition as provided by the Bioinformatics toolbox. In this procedure, we applied a cutoff to filter peaks of less than 500 ion counts (in the summed spectrum) to avoid the detection of artifacts. Centroid lists from samples were then merged into a single matrix by binning the accurate centroid masses within the tolerance given by the instrument resolution (about 0.002 amu at m\/z 300). The resulting matrix lists the intensity of each mass peak in each analyzed sample. An accurate common m\/z was recalculated with a weighted average of the values obtained from independent centroiding. Because mass axis calibration was applied online during acquisition, no m\/z correction was applied during processing to correct for potential drifts. After merging, negatively charged ions were tentatively annotated based on accurate mass using 0.001 Da tolerance (see Supplementary Table 1).

Ions and adducts were chosen based on occurrence frequency determined previously during method development[1] and are tentative in nature. We then correlated the abundance of non-annotated ions with the abundance of annotated ions across all data sets and, in case of a positive correlation (Pearson\u2019s R > 0.8), transferred this annotation.

Wax ester fermentation in Euglena is strongly increased by hypoxia, but key events underlying the metabolic shift toward wax ester biosynthesis are poorly understood. Profiling of wax esters and other lipophilic compounds is the first step for research toward the clarification of wax ester fermentation molecular mechanisms, and thus, a simple and comprehensive platform for their profiling is required. In this study, we established a profiling method for wax esters and lipophilic compounds in Euglena using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS). Using this method, we compared accumulation profiles of wax esters and lipophilic compounds between a wild-type Euglena Z strain and a bleached SM-ZK strain. Both the wild-type and the bleached strains contained C14:0 fatty acid-C14:0 fatty alcohol as a dominant wax ester. Wax ester fermentation initiated 4 h after the cessation of oxygen supply by halting the culture agitation resulting in linear increase and proportional changes of wax ester amounts during 24 h. However, complete anoxia by nitrogen gas aeration inhibited wax ester production and the addition of bicarbonates reversed the inhibition, suggesting that there is a need for an additional carbon source for wax ester fermentation under anoxia. Our simple method enables the investigation of metabolic responses leading to wax ester fermentation in Euglena.","Sample collection: In this study, Euglena gracilis wild-type Z strain and a streptomycin-bleached mutant SM-ZK with less chloroplasts ([1][2] were used. They were maintained in 150 ml of Koren-Hutner medium (pH 5.0) in Sakaguchi flasks at 27 \u00b0C under continuous light on a shaker (120 rpm) for 2 days (early-log phase) or 4 days (late-log phase) [3]. Wax ester fermentation was induced either by halting the culture agitation, which stops aeration and induces hypoxia, or by aerating N2 gas into culture medium for 10 min to remove oxygen and other gases, including carbon dioxide, completely. For anoxic conditions induced by N2 gas aeration, different NaHCO3 concentration (1 mM and 10 mM) were added to investigate the effect of a carbon source on wax fermentation. Cells were collected 0, 4, and 24 h after the initiation of anaerobiosis and were immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen followed by lyophilization. Ref: [1] Mccalla DR.

Using a systems toxicology approach in a model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C57BL\/6 mice), we assessed the health consequences in mice of smoke derived from a prototype modified risk tobacco product (pMRTP) as compared to conventional cigarettes. We investigated physiological and histological endpoints in parallel with transcriptomics, lipidomics, and proteomics profiles in mice exposed to a reference cigarette (3R4F) smoke or a pMRTP aerosol for up to 7 months. We also included a cessation group and a switching-to-pMRTP group (after 2 months of 3R4F exposure) in addition to the control (fresh air-exposed) group, to understand the potential risk reduction of switching to pMRTP compared with continuous 3R4F exposure and cessation. <\/p> The dataset shared here describes the lipidomics analyses performed on lung, liver, and plasma of these mice at multiple time points. Lipids were characterized using, in addition to (untargeted) shotgun lipidomics, a set of targeted methods to specifically characterize sphingolipids, ceramides, triglycerides, eicosanoids, and gangliosides.","Sample collection: Plasma samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Lungs from 'omics2' mice were perfused through the right ventricle using a 27-G needle with ice-cold 0.9% physiological saline to remove contaminating blood cells. After dissecting the heart, the superior, middle, and post-caval lobes from the right lung were collected and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80 \u00b0C. Similarly, a piece of liver was frozen and stored in the same way. Tissue samples were pulverized with a CP02 CryoPrep Dry Pulverization System (Covaris). Plasma samples were thawed slowly on ice. All samples were homogenized in ice-cold methanol containing 0.1% butyl-hydroxy-toluene (BHT) at a concentration of 100 mg\/ml. Homogenized samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to lipid extraction and analysis. All lipidomics analyses were performed by Zora Biosciences Oy (Espoo, Finland).","Extraction: Lipid Extraction: Robotic assisted 96-well sample preparation and extraction was performed using a Hamilton Microlab Star system (Hamilton Robotics, Bonaduz, Switzerland). A modified Folch protocol, using chloroform, methanol and acetic acid for liquid-liquid extraction [1], was applied to extract a broad lipid type spectrum [2,3]. This extraction procedure is efficient and robust over a wide lipid concentration range [4]. This method was used to extract glycerolipids, glycerophospholipids, sterol esters and sphingolipids, except for sphingosines and spingosine-1-phosphates which were extracted with 1.1 ml of ice-cold methanol containing 0.1% BHT. The Hamilton robot system was used to extract gangliosides using the methodology described by Fong and colleagues [5] with minor modifications. Eicosanoids were extracted according to the procedure by Deems [6]. Prior to extraction, the samples were spiked with known amounts of internal standards (IS). This set of ISs were used to quantify the endogenous lipids in samples and controls as described below. Following lipid extraction, samples were dried under a gentle stream of nitrogen. Samples for shotgun lipidomics, sphingolipidomics and gangliosides were reconstituted in chloroform:methanol (1:2, v\/v), whereas samples for sphingosine\/sphingosine-1-phosphate and eicosanoids were reconstituted in methanol. The final extracts were stored at \u221220 \u00b0C upon mass spectrometry analysis.

Aliquots of 10 \u00b5l were aspirated and infused. Precursor ion and neutral loss scans were carried out in positive and negative ion modes, as described previously [2-4]. On the TriVersa NanoMate electrospray ionization (ESI) voltages applied were typically 1.3 kV and -1.3 kV in positive and negative ion modes respectively. The gas pressure was set typically to 0.75 psi in both polarity modes. In the positive ion mode the following MS settings were used: curtain gas; 20, collision gas; 6, interface heater; 60, declustering potential; 30, entrance potential 10 and collision cell exit potential; 20.

PMID: 17954213 ","Data transformation: Samples from 2 month and 3 month time points were analyzed separately from 7 month time point. Variation in instrument control samples between the batches were observed in ceramide (Cer, LacCer, Glc\/GalCer and Gb3 lipid classes) and eicosanoid lipidomics platforms, and therefore correction factors were applied to endogenous lipid concentrations of these platforms. Due to the use of correction factors, the ceramide and eicosanoid concentrations at 7 month time point are relative instead of absolute. Group comparisons within a particular time point are not affected by the use of correction factors. The variation of endogenous lipid concentrations was due to internal standard (IS) issues (eicosanoids) and variation in total lipid extraction (ceramide species). The eicosanoid IS concentrations were varying between the two batches, which was observed from control samples. Variation was most likely due to evaporation of solvent from the IS vials, even though the vials were unopened and stored as recommended by the manufacturer. The correction factors were calculated based on instrument control samples (ICs), which are included in all extractions to monitor quality of the lipidomics analysis. Pooled human plasma is extracted in ICs instead of a sample, concentrations of ISs are the same as in samples, and the extraction is done in the same fashion for ICs and samples. Ten replicate ICs were run per one sample set. Endogenous lipid concentrations of eicosanoids and ceramide lipid species on 7 months' time point samples were corrected by correction factors (k) obtained from the following equation. Peak area ratios (Endogenous area \/ IS area) from ten replicate IC runs were first calculated, and then averages of these ten ratios were used for determine the correction factors according to the equation. Obviously, the correction factors were determined only to those lipids, which were detected in IC. For ceramide species the calculation was done per lipid extraction of the tissue type, for example ICs in lung sample batches were compared with each other. To calculate corrected concentration IS amount (pmol) in a sample was multiplied by k.","Metabolite id: The mass spectrometry data files were processed using LipidView\u2122 V1.0.99 and MultiQuant\u2122 2.0 softwares to generate a list of lipid names and peak areas. Shotgun lipidomics data was processed in LipidView\u2122 as described previously [1]. Briefly, the endogenous species were identified based on their characteristic fragment ions, neutral losses and parent ions. For instance, m\/z 184.1 which is the characteristic headgroup ion of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM) [2] was used to identify together with the parent mass the peaks observed in the mass spectrum of PIS 184.1 in positive ion mode. In a similar way the monitored acyl ions were utilized to identify the molecular species in negative ion mode [3]. For instance, identification of PC 16:0-18:1 requires corresponding signals from both the 16:0 (PIS of m\/z 255.2) and the 18:1 (PIS of m\/z 281.2) scans. MRM data was processed in MultiQuant\u2122. The selected lipid characteristic ions and their parent masses in conjunction with retention time were used for the identification of the endogenous species. Information dependent acquisition (IDA) experiments were used for confirming identifications. MRM was used as survey scan to trigger the IDA, followed by enhanced product ion (EPI) scans of two most intense ions. The identified lipids were quantified by normalizing against their respective internal standard and matrix type, e.g. volume for plasma, and presented accordingly (e.g. \u00b5M for plasma). Total lipid class concentrations were calculated by summing-up the concentrations of species belonging to the same class. Molar distribution percentages were generated by dividing all the observed lipid concentrations to the class total concentration within the sample. Data filtering of the final data set was based on the frequency of individual lipid molecules observed throughout the collected data. Molecules observed from less than 75% of the samples, and molecules lacking lipid class specific internal standards were excluded. Molecules having four fold lower or higher concentration than the median of the group was considered as an outlier and excluded. Filtering procedures were performed separately for both polarity modes and lipidomic assessment, prior to merging of the final lipidomic data set. All the calculations and data processing were performed using SAS 9.3 (SAS Institute). Ref: [1] Ejsing CS, Duchoslav E, Sampaio J, Simons K, Bonner R, Thiele C, Ekroos K, Shevchenko A.

PXE is caused by inactivating mutations in the gene encoding ABCC6 (MRP6), an ATP-dependent efflux transporter that is mainly present in the liver. Abcc6-\/- mice have been instrumental in the demonstration that PXE is a metabolic disease caused by the absence of an unknown factor in the circulation, the presence of which depends on ABCC6 in the liver. Why absence of this factor results in PXE remained a mystery. We now show that medium from HEK293 cells overexpressing either human or rat ABCC6 potently inhibits mineralization in vitro, whereas medium of HEK293 control cells does not. Untargeted metabolomics revealed that cells expressing ABCC6 excrete large amounts of nucleoside triphosphates, even though ABCC6 itself did not transport nucleoside triphosphates. Extracellularly, ectonucleotidases hydrolyzed the excreted nucleoside triphosphates to nucleoside monophosphates and inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a strong inhibitor of mineralization that plays a pivotal role in several mineralization disorders similar to PXE. The in vivo relevance of our data was demonstrated in Abcc6-\/- mice, which had plasma PPi levels that were less than 40% of those found in wild-type mice. This study provides the first insight into how ABCC6 affects PXE. Our data indicate that the factor that normally prevents PXE is PPi, which is provided to the circulation in the form of nucleoside triphosphates via an as yet unidentified, but ABCC6-dependent mechanism.","Sample collection: Whole blood was collected in syringes containing 7.5 I.U. of heparin by cardiac puncture and kept on ice until separation of plasma and erythrocytes by centrifugation (10 min, 1,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C).

Using chemostat culture, we have measured the impact of changes in flux (growth rate) on the transcriptome, proteome, endometabolome and exometabolome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Each functional genomic level shows clear growth-rate-associated trends and discriminates between carbon-sufficient and carbon-limited conditions. Genes consistently and significantly upregulated with increasing growth rate are frequently essential and encode evolutionarily conserved proteins of known function that participate in many protein-protein interactions. In contrast, more unknown, and fewer essential, genes are downregulated with increasing growth rate; their protein products rarely interact with one another. A large proportion of yeast genes under positive growth-rate control share orthologs with other eukaryotes, including humans. Significantly, transcription of genes encoding components of the TOR complex (a major controller of eukaryotic cell growth) is not subject to growth-rate regulation. Moreover, integrative studies reveal the extent and importance of post-transcriptional control, patterns of control of metabolic fluxes at the level of enzyme synthesis, and the relevance of specific enzymatic reactions in the control of metabolic fluxes during cell growth.","Sample collection: The diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain FY1679 were grown in fermenters, essentially as described before [1]. A set of chemostat cultures under C-, N-, P- and S-limiting conditions were established at a series of dilution rates (0.07, 0.10, 0.20 \/h). Cultures were fed with a defined mineral medium limiting growth by carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, or sulphur, all other nutritional requirements were in excess at a constant residual concentration. Glucose and vitamins were added to the medium after separate sterilization. Glucose was heat-sterilized at 120 \u00b0C. Vitamins were prepared and sterilized by filtration through 0.2 \u00b5m filters (Sartopore\u00ae2, Sartorius, UK). Chemostat cultivation was performed in 2-litre fermenters (FT Applikon Ltd., UK) with a working volume of 1.0 l, a temperature of 30 \u00b0C and a stirrer speed of 750 rpm. The culture pH was maintained at 5.0 by automatic addition of 2 M NaOH or HCl as required, via an Applikon ADI-1030 biocontroller. Aerobic cultivation was performed by maintaining an air flow of 1.0 l\/min. The dissolved oxygen concentration in all chemostat cultures, as measured with an Ingold polarographic oxygen electrode, was above 50% of saturation. To avoid loss of volatile metabolites, the off-gas condenser was cooled to 4 \u00b0C, connected to a cryostat. Off-gas oxygen and carbon dioxide levels were monitored with a Tandem gas analyser (Magellan Instruments, UK). Steady state conditions were deemed established once biomass levels (absorbance and dry weight measurements), dissolved oxygen, and off-gas fractions remained constant over three residence times (three volume changes). For the rapamycin study, a batch culture growing at mid-exponential phase in minimal medium was established under the same cultivation conditions as for chemostat experiments. This was divided into two flasks. Rapamycin (200 ng\/ml) was added to one half, and the vehicle added to the other, as the control. Samples were taken at 0, 1, 2 and 4 hrs after the treatment.

Direct quenching of the culture was performed by fast sampling of a volume of culture equivalent to 30 mg dry weight; extracts and culture supernatants were stored at -80 \u00b0C.

","Chromatography: Two different sample types were analyzed, endometabolome and exometabolome. Endometabolome samples (typically 1000 \u00b5l) were spiked with 4 \u00b5l internal standard solution (2.22 mg\/ml [\u00b2H2]malonic acid, 1.92 mg\/ml [\u00b2H5]glycine and 0.61 mg\/ml [\u00b9\u00b3C6]glucose dissolved in water) and lyophilized using a Speedvac concentrator vacuum system SPD111V connected to a Micromodulyo Freeze Dryer (ThermoLife Sciences, Basingstoke, UK). Exometabolome samples (200 \u00b5l) were spiked with 20 \u00b5l internal standard solution and lyophilized as previously described. Dried samples were derivatized as follows; 100 \u00b5l of 20 mg\/ml O-methylhydroxylamine solution was added and heated at 40 \u00b0C for 90 minutes followed by addition of 100 \u00b5l N-acetyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacetamide and heating at 40 \u00b0C for 120 mins. The final solution was spiked with 20 \u00b5l retention index solution (0.6 mg\/ml n-decane, n-dodecane, n-pentadecane, n-nonadecane, n-docosane dissolved in hexane). Chromatography was carried out on Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph using the manufacturer's software (ChromaTOF version 2.12) and a DB-50 GC column (Supelco, Gillingham, UK; 30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness).","Mass spec: The sample was injected (1 \u00b5l) split ratio of 1 in 3 into a Agilent 6890 GC equipped with DB-50 GC column (injector temperature = 270 \u00b0C, helium carrier gas flow rate = 1 ml\/min). The initial column temperature was 70 \u00b0C; this was held for 2 mins and then increased by 24 \u00b0C\/min to 280 \u00b0C and hold for 5 mins. The column effluent was introduced into a LECO Pegasus III time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LECO, St Joseph, MI) with transfer line temperature = 250 \u00b0C, ion source temperature = 230 \u00b0C). The TOF mass spectrometer can collect spectra at up to 500 Hz and mass range of 30\u2013500 m\/z.

Initial processing of raw data was undertaken using LECO ChromaTOF v2.12 software to construct a data matrix (metabolite peak versus sample number) using response ratios (peak area metabolite\/peak area [\u00b2H2]malonic acid) to calculate the relative amount of each metabolite in each sample. For each metabolite peak for each set of three biological replicates, the CV was calculated as follows: %CV = (standard deviation\/mean) \u00d7 100. The mean CV for replicate analytical analyses (n = 3) was 24.6% for all analyses undertaken, with 62% of these analyses having a CV less than 20% and 38.04% having one less than 10%. Although this shows precision to be less robust than for targeted analyses, this is appropriate in metabolic profiling, where many hundreds of metabolites are detected in short analysis times.","Metabolite id: Metabolite peaks were initially identified by searches on a commercially available mass spectral library [NIST\/EPA\/NIH (02)] (US National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institutes of Health; 2002) and libraries prepared by one of us (W.B.D.). For a peak to be identified required a similarity and reverse match score of greater than 700. Metabolite identification was confirmed by the analysis of pure chemical standards in identical conditions to the sample analysis. Identification was confirmed if the retention time (\u00b15 secs) and mass spectra (similarity and reverse matches greater than 750) of metabolite peak in sample and standard were equivalent."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS8","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS8","title":"Growth control of the eukaryote cell: a systems biology study in yeast","date":"2012-04-19","timestamp":1334790000,"submitter":["Juan Castrillo","Stephen Oliver","Warwick Dunn","Neil Swainston"],"publications":[{"title":"Growth control of the eukaryote cell: a systems biology study in yeast.","doi":"10.1186\/jbiol54","pubmed":"PMID:17439666"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Agilent 6890 GC - LECO Pegasus III TOF MS (LECO)","organism":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae","organism_parts":"whole organism","metabolites":["pyridine impurity","1,2-ethylene glycol","1,2-butandiol","1,3-propanediol","2-furaldehyde","ammonia","trihydroxylamine","lactic acid","alanine","phenolic acid","glycine","valine","alpha-hydroxyvaleric acid","glycerol","4-methyl, 2-hydroxy pentanoic acid","leucine","sulphate","isoleucine","serine","phosphoric acid","glyceric acid","threonine","fumaric acid","benzoic acid","succinic acid","N-acetylalanine","homoserine","3-methyl 1,2-hydroxybutane","uracil","citramalic acid","ethylphosphate","malic acid","aspartic acid","2-isopropyl-malic acid","cysteine","arginine","2-hydroxyglutaric acid","3,4-dimethylenedioxy mandelic acid","glutamic acid","2,4-dimethylbenzoic acid","2-hydroxyphenylethanol","2-ketoglutaric acid","pyroglutamic acid","5-hydroxy furancarboxylic acid","tropic acid","phenylalanine","sugar or sugar alcohol","1,6-anhydroglucose","mannose","isocitric acid","citric acid","glutamine","lysine","3-phosphoglycerate","dextrose","4-deoxypyridoxine","glucopyranose","glucose","N-acetylglutamic acid","myo-inositol","diphenylketone","tyrosine","myo-inositol-1-phosphate","cadaverine","histidine","pantothenic acid","hexadecanoic acid","hexadecenoic acid","carbamoyl-aspartic acid","S-adenosylmethionine","adenine","heptadecanoic acid","aspartic acid derivative","cystathionine","octadecanoic acid","catecholpyruvic acid","glucose-6-phosphate","glucose-6-phosphate|glucose-1-phosphate","myo-inositol-6-phosphate","tryptophan","gluconic acid","cinnamic acid","glutathione","galactose-6-phosphate","galactinol","sucrose","adenosine-5-monophosphate","1-monohexadecanoylglycerol","maltose","trehalose","dehydroabietic acid","isomaltose","stearic acid-propyl ester","sugar-phosphate","dehydroergosterol","S-adenosylhomocysteine"]}},"MTBLS351":{"description":["Insulin resistance is a forerunner state of ischaemic cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we show how the human gut microbiome impacts the serum metabolome and associates with insulin resistance in 277 non-diabetic Danish individuals. The serum metabolome of insulin-resistant individuals is characterized by increased levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), which correlate with a gut microbiome that has an enriched biosynthetic potential for BCAAs and is deprived of genes encoding bacterial inward transporters for these amino acids. Prevotella copri and Bacteroides vulgatus are identified as the main species driving the association between biosynthesis of BCAAs and insulin resistance, and in mice we demonstrate that P. copri can induce insulin resistance, aggravate glucose intolerance and augment circulating levels of BCAAs. Our findings suggest that microbial targets may have the potential to diminish insulin resistance and reduce the incidence of common metabolic and cardiovascular disorders.","Sample collection: The study population comprised 291 normoglycaemic and middle-aged Danish MetaHIT individuals as previously reported[1], as well as 75 Danish type 2 diabetes patients[2]. All analyses involving gut microbiome data were restricted to 75 type 2 diabetes patients and 277 out of the 291 of the non-diabetic individuals whose data passed all quality control criteria (see details below), whereas all non-microbiome analyses involved the full set of 291 non-diabetic individuals. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. Of the 75 type 2 diabetes patients, 10 patients (13%) received no hyperglycaemic medications, 58 patients (77%) received the biguanide compound, metformin; of these 28 patients (37%) received metformin as the only anti-hyperglycaemic medication, 10 patients (13%) received sulfonylurea alone or in combination with metformin, 14 patients (19%) received a combination of oral anti-diabetic drugs and insulin treatment and 4 patients (5%) were on insulin treatment only. 11 patients (15%) were treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), all of them in combination with metformin. Patients were reported as receiving anti-hypertensive treatment if at least 1 of the following drugs were reported: spironolactone, thiazides, loop diuretics, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, moxonidin or drugs affecting the renin-angiotensin system (in total n=55; 73%). Patients receiving statins were reported as receiving lipid-lowering medication (in total n=56; 75%). We have previously shown that metformin has impact on the configuration and functional potential of human gut microbiota whereas no significant differences were observed for other anti-diabetic medications, diuretics, or lipid lowering- and blood pressure lowering drugs.[2] In short, all study participants (Caucasian Danes) were recruited from the population-based Inter99 study[3] or from the outpatient clinic at Steno Diabetes Center. Study volunteers were invited for 2 visits with approximately 14 days apart. At the first visit the participants were examined in the morning after an overnight fast of at least 10 hr and without prior morning physical activity. At the second visit a DEXA scan was performed to evaluate body fat percentage. All samples (from both non-diabetic and diabetic individuals) were generated within the Danish part of the MetaHIT consortium (http:\/\/www.metahit.eu), and the infrastructure of this project was constructed specifically to make all samples comparable by ensuring similar handling and by minimizing the risk of batch effects. All of these samples were collected individually as participant recruitment proceeded, by the same staff. Serum samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until the planned analysis took place.

PMID:20650010 ","Metabolite id: Polar metabolite analysis (GCxGC-TOF-MS) All serum metabolite peaks that were present (non-zero value) in more than 50% of samples were included in the data analyses, including the unidentified ones. We reasoned that inclusion of complete data as obtained from the platform best represent the global metabolome as covered by the platform. The unidentified peaks were annotated with their structural class from the Golm Metabolome Database[1] using functional group prediction based on the fragmentation patterns[2]. In total 325 (94 known and 231 unknown) serum polar metabolites were measured in the human study. Lipidomic analysis (UHPLC-QTOF-MS) Serum lipids were identified using an internal spectral library or with tandem MS and data were normalized using the internal standards representatives of each class of serum lipid present in the samples as previously described[3]. Sphingomyelins were normalized with the PC standard. All lipid peaks were included in the data analyses, including the unidentified ones. Control serum samples (n = 30), extracted standard samples (n = 22) as well as blanks and pure standard samples were analyzed together with the study samples. The standard deviation (RSD) for internal standards, spiked into the samples, was 8-13% in serum samples (n = 397) and 9.1% in the extracted standards (n = 22). The RSD% of the identified lipids in the control serum samples was on average 12.8%. In total 876 molecular serum lipids, 289 known and 587 unknown, were measured. Neither sample preparation nor analysis order showed any significant effect on the results. Ref: [1] Kopka, J. et al. GMD@CSB.DB: the Golm Metabolome Database.

use of glucocorticoids as growth promoters for meat-producing animals is strictly regulated within the European Union. However, in the past few years, a higher frequency of non-compliant bovine urine samples for prednisolone has been noticed, which could not be directly related to fraudulent use of prednisolone. As such, questions have risen about the origin of this compound. Unfortunately, at present, no decisive strategy has been established to discriminate between endogenous and exogenous prednisolone. In this study, an untargeted metabolomics strategy, based on Orbitrap and QqTOF mass spectrometry, was deployed to reveal urinary biomarkers, which are indicative for the exogenous administration of the synthetic glucocorticoid prednisolone. For this purpose, prednisolone was administered intramuscularly and per os to 12 bovines and a total of 2700 urine samples were collected before, during and after treatment. Multivariate statistical data analysis (i.e. OPLS-DA) revealed four differentiating metabolites that allowed discrimination between urine samples collected before and during prednisolone administration. None of these compounds were present in urine containing endogenous prednisolone, of which the formation was induced by the administration of a synthetic analogue of adrenocorticotropic hormone. Only one metabolite was retained as a highly suitable biomarker during growth-promoting and therapeutic prednisolone treatment, with 93.4 % sensitivity and 96.3 % specificity. Besides, this compound could be detected up to 4 days after a single therapeutic per os prednisolone administration. Based on accurate mass, isotope pattern, and MS\/MS spectra, this compound was putatively annotated and is suggested as an actionable biomarker for exogenous prednisolone administration.","Sample collection: Animals: In this study, a diverse group of cattle was compiled in order to include the potential influence of biological variation on the specific biomarker identification. More specifically, twelve healthy cows of a mixed breed, varying age (2\u20136 yrs) and with a body weight between 360 and 570 kg were housed for 8 months under controlled experimental conditions in the animal facilities of the Centre d\u2019Economie Rurale (CER) (Marloie, Belgium). The animals were fed a commercially available diet, commonly applied in zootechnical practice, with ad libitum access to water and hay. During the entire study, animals were kept in 3 separate groups (4 animals per group) and all housed in a half covered pen. Prior to the in vivo study, an initial acclimatization period of 14 days was considered. In order to consider animal growth during the in vivo study, the animals were weighted at the start and at the end of the experiment, but no significant differences were observed. The in vivo study was approved by CER\u2019s Ethical Committee (CE\/Sante\/ET\/004). Experimental protocol: After the acclimatization period, which served as control, all animals underwent the same sequential prednisolone treatments: a growth-promoting treatment (long-term, 40 mg\/cow\/day) followed by a therapeutic treatment (short-term, 0.5 mg\/kg b.w.\/day). The specific dosages were based on literature findings [1][2][3] to ensure relevant levels of prednisolone and potential metabolites in urine. The growth-promoting treatment started with 30 consecutive days of oral administration of 40 mg\/day of prednisolone (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis, USA) (Day + 1 till Day + 30) (PO1), followed by a washout period of 10 days (WO1). Next, intramuscular injections of 40 mg\/day of Solu-Delta-Cortef (prednisolone sodium succinate, Zoetis, Zaventem, Belgie) were given for 30 consecutive days (Day + 41 till Day + 70) (IM1). Before the start of the therapeutic prednisolone treatment, a washout period of 35 days was considered (WO2). During the therapeutic prednisolone treatment, a similar experimental set-up was implemented. First, the animals received 0.5 mg\/kg b.w. of prednisolone per os for 5 days (Day + 106 till Day + 110) (PO2), which was followed by a washout period of 25 days (WO3). Next, intramuscular injections of 0.5 mg\/kg b.w. of Solu-Delta-Cortef were administered during 5 consecutive days (Day + 136 till Day + 140) (IM2). A final washout period of 32 days (Day + 141 till Day + 172) was respected (WO4). During the periods of oral administration, one capsule containing the appropriate amount of prednisolone, using lactose as excipient, was given in the morning just after feeding, using a capsule launcher. The intramuscular injections were placed in the neck and were alternatedevery day from the left to the right side in order to minimize irritation. Collection: Urine samples were collected in the morning, 5 min before prednisolone administration, by a veterinarian using a probe (to prevent faecal contamination), immediately portioned into 15 ml tubes, and stored in the dark at -80 \u00b0C until analysis [4]. As for the samplingrate, during the acclimatization period, urine samples were collected daily. During the therapeutic and growth-promoting prednisolone treatments and washout periods, samples were collected every 5 days. Ref: [1] Cannizzo, F.

A first step relates to the extraction of urine samples. Due to the large number of collected urine samples, sample preparation and analysis were performed in subsequent batches of four animals. The first batch considered of the urine samples of animals 1, 5, 7 and 12. The second batch contained theurine samples of animals 2, 4, 6 and 11, and the last batch included urine of animals 3, 8, 9 and 10. Instrumental stability (quality control measure) during mass spectrometric analyses was verified by considering standard injections. These injections were run at the beginning and repeated every 25 samples. This mixture consisted of cortisol, cortisone, dihydrocortisone, prednisolone, prednisone, methylprednisolone, 20alpha-dihydroprednisolone and 20beta-dihydroprednisolone. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 162) were obtained for the various glucocorticoids: 6.39% for cortisol, 5.51% for cortisone, 6.79% for dihydrocortisone, 3.09% for prednisolone, 4.35% for prednisone, 8.93% for methylprednisolone, 7.61% for 20alpha-dihydroprednisolone and 6.94% for 20beta-dihydroprednisolone. The second step involved data pre-processing (peak list generation), thereby using either Sieve 2.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, USA) or MarkerViewTM 1.2.1.1 (SCIEX, California, USA) software, to respectively process Exactive (raw.files). Applied parameter values included an m\/z-range of 150\u2013650 Da, a m\/z width of 5 ppm, a retention time window ranging from 1 to 9.5 min, a peak intensity threshold of 100,000 arbitrary units, a maximum peak width of 0.5 min and a maximum number of 10,000 frames. Furthermore, corrections for inherent chromatographic variability along samples were made during the peak alignment process. This strategy rendered a list of features (detected ions) that were characterized by their m\/z-value, retention time and signal abundance. The signal intensities of these ions were for each sample normalized by the average signal intensity of the two deuterium labeled internal standards i.e. cortisol-d4 and prednisolone-d8, which were supplemented prior to extraction. Moreover, since urine is a matrix subjected to potential dilution effects, a secondary normalization was implemented. normalization by means of specific gravity (Pocket Refractometer, Atago, Tokyo) based on the Levine\u2013Fahyequation (correction factor ranged from 1.003 to 1.0044) was implemented. In the final step, multivariate statistical analysis was performed by means of SIMCATM 13 software (Umetrics, Malmo, Sweden)."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS185","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS185","title":"Metabolic fingerprinting reveals a novel candidate biomarker for prednisolone treatment in cattle","date":"2017-01-12","timestamp":1484179200,"submitter":["Nathalie De Clercq","Julie Vanden Bussche","Lieven Van Meulebroek","Siska Croube","Lynn Vanhaecke","Philippe Delahaut"],"publications":[{"title":"Metabolic fingerprint reveals a novel biomarker for prednisolone treatment in cattle.","doi":"10.1007\/s11306-015-0887-3","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Exactive (Thermo Scientific)","organism":"Bos taurus","organism_parts":"urine"}},"MTBLS340":{"description":["Chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG) is one of the most important pre-cancerous states with a high prevalence. Exploring of the underlying mechanism and potential biomarkers is of significant importance for CAG. In the present work, 1H NMR-based metabonomics with correlative analysis was performed to analyze the metabolic features of CAG. 19 plasma metabolites and 18 urine metabolites were enrolled to construct the circulatory and excretory metabolome of CAG, which was in response to alterations of energy metabolism, inflammation, immune dysfunction, as well as oxidative stress. 7 plasma biomarkers and 7 urine biomarkers were screened to elucidate the pathogenesis of CAG based on the further correlation analysis with biochemical indexes. Finally, 3 plasma biomarkers (arginine, succinate and 3-hydroxybutyrate) and 2 urine biomarkers (a-ketoglutarate and valine) highlighted the potential to indicate risks of CAG in virtue of correlation with pepsin activity and ROC analysis. Here, our results paved a way for elucidating the underlying mechanisms in the development of CAG, and provided new avenues for the diagnosis of CAG and presented potential drug targets for treatment of CAG.","Sample collection: At the end of the experiment, rats were housed individually in metabolic cages for 24 h urinary collection (containing 0.05% sodium azide) after a 12 h fast.","Extraction: Whole urine samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 rpm.

These spectra were measured using a spin\u2013echo loop time (2nt) of 35 ms to attenuate broad signals from lipids and proteins and only to assist observation of small metabolites. Each 1H NMR spectrum consisted of 64 scans requiring 5 min of acquisition time with the following parameters: spectral width: 12,335.5 Hz; spectral size: 65,536 points; pulse width: 30\u00b0 (12.6 s); and relaxation delay (RD): 5.0 s. FIDs were Fourier-transformed with LB = 0.3 Hz.","Data transformation: All NMR spectra were then corrected for phase and baseline distortions using MestReNova (version 8.0.1, Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Com-postella, Spain). The integral values of each spectrum were normalized to a total sum of the spectrum, decreasing any significant differences between samples. The peaks of plasma spectra were referenced internally to the chemical shift of creatinine at \u03b4 3.04 ppm. The plasma spectra were divided and the signal integral computed in 0.01 ppm intervals across the region \u03b4 0.50-9.00 ppm. The region of \u03b4 4.68-5.19 ppm was excluded from the analysis to eliminate the effects of imperfect water saturation. The data was then normalized to the total sum of the spectra prior to analysis. For NMR spectra recorded in urine extracts, they were referenced to the chemical shift of TSP at \u03b4 0.00 ppm. Using MestReNova, the regions 0.50-9.00 ppm of the urine spectra were reduced into integral bins of equal width (0.01 ppm).

Our experimental conduct [1] did not aim for phosphatidic acid (PA), cholesterol, and cholesteryl ester (CE) classes, due to methodological considerations and the properties of the biological sample (bulk amounts of TG). Within the detection limits of the method, ether lipids were found. In the following, we present data on TG, DG, and PL species in \u2030 relative to total amount of respective lipid class to facilitate recognition of nutritional phenotypes at lipidomic levels. Constituent FA of phosphatidylserine (PS), PE, PC, DG, and TG species were analyzed in positive MS\/MS spectra by respective FA neutral losses. FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m\/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS\/MS spectra. The most-abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS\/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species.

This is based on the hypothesis that metabolome levels should reflect impaired skeletal muscle bioenergetics in COPD. The study aims to test this hypothesis by evaluating plasma metabolic profiles in COPD patients before and after 8 weeks of endurance exercise training. We studied blood samples from 18 COPD patients and 12 healthy subjects. Pre- and post-training blood plasma samples at rest and after constant-work rate exercise (CWRE) at 70% of pretraining Watts peak were analyzed by 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to assess metabolite profiles. The two groups presented training-induced physiological changes in the VO2 peak and in blood lactate levels (P0.01 each). Before training, the two groups also showed differences in metabolic profiles at rest (P0.05). Levels of valine (r = 0.51, P0.01), alanine (r = 0.45, P0.05) and isoleucine (r = 0.51, P0.01) were positively associated with body composition (Fat Free Mass Index). While training showed a significant impact on the metabolic profile in healthy subjects (P0.001), with changes in levels of amino acids, creatine, succinate, pyruvate, glucose and lactate (P0.05 each), no equivalent training-induced effects were seen in COPD patients in whom only lactate decreased (P0.05). This study shows that plasma metabolic profiling contributes to the phenotypic characterization of COPD patients.","Sample collection: We prospectively recruited 18 clinically stable COPD patients and 12 healthy sedentary[1] age matched controls.

The spectra were phase corrected and were referenced using the internal standard, TMSP (0 ppm). Moreover, for pre-processing before modeling, the 2D data was skyline-projected into one dimension and linearly baseline-corrected. Spectra were projected to maintain couplings, i.e. were not tilted. Regions corresponding to the water signal, the TMSP signal, the acetate and EDTA signals were zeroed. The resulting spectra were scaled to a total area of unity, aligned and bucketed with a bucket size of 4 points, and then subjected to a generalized log transformation with k = 5e^-8 to increase the weighting of weaker signals in the spectrum giving a final matrix of 124 (samples) x 4096 (data points in each spectrum).

In our longitudinal observational study, we applied a (1)H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based global, untargeted metabolomics strategy on human serum samples that were collected before and repeatedly <=1 y after distinct bariatric procedures [i.e., a sleeve gastrectomy, proximal Roux-en Y gastric bypass (RYGB), and distal RYGB]. For comparison, we also analyzed serum samples from normal-weight and less-obese subjects who were matched for 1-y postoperative body mass index (BMI) values of the surgical groups. We identified a metabolomic fingerprint in obese subjects that was clearly discriminated from that of normal-weight subjects. Furthermore, we showed that bariatric surgery (sleeve gastrectomy and proximal and distal RYGB) dynamically affected this fingerprint in a procedure-dependent manner, thereby establishing new fingerprints that could be discriminated from those of BMI-matched and normal-weight control subjects. Metabolites that largely contributed to the metabolomic fingerprints of severe obesity were aromatic and branched-chain amino acids (elevated), metabolites related to energy metabolism (pyruvate and citrate; elevated), and metabolites suggested to be derived from gut microbiota (formate, methanol, and isopropanol; all elevated).

The biosynthesis features the generation of isonitrile from a single precursor Gly promoted by a thioesterase and a non-heme iron(II)-dependent oxidase homologue, and the acylation of both amino groups of Lys by the same isonitrile acyl chain facilitated by a single condensation domain of a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS).

The metabolic-genetic make-up of the cell, as reflected in auxotrophy, is hence likely to be a determinant of gene expression.

The metabolic background affected up to 85% of the coding genome. Suggesting widespread confounding, these transcriptional changes show, on average, 83% overlap between unrelated auxotrophs and 35% with previously published transcriptomes generated for non-metabolic gene knockouts. Background-dependent gene expression correlated with metabolic flux and acted, predominantly through masking or suppression, on 88% of transcriptional interactions epistatically. As a consequence, the deletion of the same metabolic gene in a different background could provoke an entirely different transcriptional response. Propagating to the proteome and scaling up at the metabolome, metabolic background dependencies reveal the prevalence of metabolism-dependent epistasis at all regulatory levels. Urging a fundamental change of the prevailing laboratory practice of using auxotrophs and nutrient supplemented media, these results reveal epistatic intertwining of metabolism with gene expression on the genomic scale.","Sample collection: Pre-cultures of the S. cerevisiae strains were prepared in drop-in media (synthetic minimal media supplemented only with the nutrients to complement auxotrophic requirements) and cultured for 12-20 h in a 96-well plate (30 \u00b0C, 250 rpm).

Differences in the metabolic fingerprints of wild-type Solanum lycopersicum and three monogenic mutants, ripening inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor) and Colourless non-ripening (Cnr), of tomato are captured with regard to ripening behaviour. A high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry system coupled to liquid chromatography produced a time series of the ripening behaviour at discrete intervals with a focus on changes post-anthesis. Internal standards and quality controls were used to ensure system stability. The raw data of the samples and reference compounds including study protocols have been deposited in the open metabolomics database MetaboLights via the metadata annotation tool Isatab to enable efficient re-use of the datasets, such as in metabolomics cross-study comparisons or data fusion exercises.","Sample collection: Wild-type Solanum lycopersicum (Ailsa Craig, AC++) and three ripening inhibited AC++ mutants were used in this study: non-ripening (NOR), ripening-inhibited (RIN), and colourless non-ripe (CNR) tomatoes. The plants were grown in 24 cm-diameter pots in M3 compost (Levington Horticulture, Ipswich, and Suffolk, UK) and watered daily under standard greenhouse conditions. Flowers were sampled in five to ten day intervals up to anthesis (10, 15, 20, 30, 40) and daily post-anthesis (47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54).

MS\/MS spectra were obtained in a data dependent manner through higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD, normalized collision energy: 50.0) at a resolution of 7,500. The two most intense mass spectral peaks detected in each scan were fragmented to give MS2 spectra (100-900 m\/z). Full scan data was acquired in FT (accurate mass) mode, MS\/MS spectra were acquired in centroid mode.

Despite several merits, metabolomics based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a developing area that is yet attached to several pitfalls and challenges. To reach a level of high reliability and robustness, these issues need to be tackled by implementation of refined experimental and computational protocols. <\/p> Objectives: This study illustrates some key pitfalls in LC-MS based metabolomics and introduces an automated computational procedure to compensate for them. <\/p> Methods: Non-cancerous mammary gland derived cells were exposed to 21 chemicals from four pharmacological classes plus a set of 6 pesticides. Changes in the metabolome of cell lysates were assessed after 24h using LC-MS. A data processing pipeline was established and evaluated to handle issues including contaminants, carry over effects, intensity decay and inherent methodology variability and biases. A key component in this pipeline is a latent variable method called OOS-DA (optimal orthonormal system for discriminant analysis), being theoretically more easily motivated than PLS-DA in this context, as it is rooted in pattern classification rather than regression modeling. <\/p> Results: The pipeline is shown to reduce experimental variability\/biases and is used to confirm that LC-MS spectra hold drug class specific information. <\/p> Conclusions: LC-MS based metabolomics is a promising methodology, but comes with pitfalls and challenges. Key difficulties can be largely overcome by means of a computational procedure of the kind introduced and demonstrated here. The pipeline is freely available on www.github.com\/stephanieherman\/MS-data-processing.","Sample collection: Immortalized, non-cancerous MCF-10A (ATCC, www.atcc.org, Manassas, VA), derived from normal human mammary gland, were grown in MEBM supplemented with MEGM Single Quots and cholera toxin (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) on cover glasses placed inside petri dishes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, NuncTM, 8.8 cm^2). After reaching ~70% confluence, equivalent to ~2 million cells, the cells were exposed to one of 27 agents for 24 h. Three biological replicates were created in order to catch biological variation. After 24 h incubation in presence of test agents, cells were harvested. Cover glasses were carefully lifted from the bottom of the petri plates using tweezers and then dipped into the stirring water of the washing unit to rinse both sides of the cover glasses. They were then quickly placed in the quenching solution (80% methanol) followed by detachment of cells using a rubber-tipped cell scraper (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht, Germany).","Extraction: Detached cells were transferred to 1.5 ml conical centrifuge tubes and centrifuged for 10 min at 21,000 x g 4\u00b0C.

Determining metabolic biomarkers for drought tolerance may be a useful implementation in increasing and stabilizing crop plant productivity. The most accurate and fast tool for this purpose is the ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). It enabled a rapid discrimination between samples from plants grown in different water limitation regimes. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to handle and interpret the complexity of the generated data. UHPLC raw data was mathematically pre-processed to reduce the effects of instrumental factors. The multivariate analysis of variance was used to find the significant changes in the secondary metabolites composition induced by the drought stress. Tests were performed on 9 varieties of spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) originating from Europe, North America and Syria. Drought stress was applied at different developmental stages. The UHPLC results suggest that the changes in metabolite profiles are a stage-specific trait and alter in the life cycle. In addition, there is variability in metabolites selected as significant for the reaction to drought depending on sampling time and variety. In parallel, an ion trap mass spectrometer with an electrospray ion source coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV detector was used for qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds and identification of the potential biomarkers.","Sample collection: Nine spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) genotypes were used in the experiment: European varieties Georgia, Maresi, Lubuski, Sebastian and Stratus, Morex - bred in USA, and Cam\/B1\/C1\u2026\/CL05761 (hereinafter referred to CamB1), Harmal and Maris Dingo\/Deir Alla 106 (hereafter referred to as MDingo) being lines bred in Syria. Experiment was conducted in a greenhouse under partially controlled conditions. Plants grew in pots filled with loam-sandy soil. Four water regimes were applied: control (C) and three drought treatments in different developmental stages (S1, S2 and S3) as follows: C: 12% of soil moisture during all vegetation season; S1: first drought treatment: at the 3-lives stage, soil moisture in the pots was decreased to 6%, which was achieved within 48 hours, and maintained during 10 days; S2: second drought treatment: decreased soil moisture to 6% started at the stage of the flag leaf and maintained during 14 days; S3: combined drought treatment: S1 and S2 variants of drought applied on the same plants. Leaf samples were harvested from the stressed and control plants in four replicates after 1, 3, 6 and 10 days of drought which is marked as I, II, III, IV moments of drought treatments for S1 and C respectively and V, VI, VII, VIII moments of drought treatments for S2, S3, C respectively. Harvested material was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u201380 \u00b0C until the metabolite extraction and instrumental analysis.","Extraction: All reagents and solvents for extraction and LC-MS analyses (methanol, acetonitrile and ultrapure water HPLC or LC-MS grade) were from Sigma-Aldrich (Poznan, Poland). Standards of flavonoids (apigenin, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-6-C-glucoside, apigenin-8-C-glucoside, isorhamnetin, luteolin, luteolin 7-O-glucoside, luteolin 4\u2019-O-glucoside, luteolin-8-C-glucoside, luteolin-6-C-glucoside, kaempferol, kaempferol-3-O-glucoside, kaempferol-7-O-glucoside, quercetin) were purchased from the Extrasynthese (Genay, France). Weighted samples of frozen leaves (about 100 mg) were placed in Eppendorf tubes with 1.4 ml of 80% methanol and the internal standard solution, homogenized using a ball mill (MM 400, Retsch, Haan, Germany) and subsequently placed in an ultrasonic bath for 30 min and centrifuged (11,000 x g) for 10 min. Apigenin (5 \u00b5l of 1 mg\/ml solution in dimethylsulfoxide) were used as the internal standards in extracts prepared for the HPLC-MS and UPLC analyses. Obtained extracts (200 \u00b5l) were filtered through 0.45 \u00b5m GHP Acrodisc 13 filter (Waters) and subjected to HPLC-MS. Prior to the UPLC analysis extracts were diluted with 80% methanol (800 \u00b5l).","Chromatography: UPLC-PDA analysis was performed using the Acquity Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography system with a photodiode - array detector (Waters, Milford, USA). The studies were carried out on BEH C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m particle size) (Waters) at 40 \u00b0C with a mobile phase flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min with water containing 0.1% formic acid v\/v (solvent A) and acetonitrile (B). The elution was conducted with gradient: 0-1.5 min from 2 to 8% B, 1.5-3.5 min to 14% B; 3.5-6 min to 16% B; 6-8 min to 25% B; 8-9.2 min to 98% B, at 10.5 min solvent composition returned to the starting conditions and equilibration of system was achieved at 12 min. The injection volume was 2 \u00b5l. Chromatographic profiles were acquired in the wavelength range 210-450 nm with resolution 2 nm. Data treatment was carried out with Empower 2 Chromatography Data Software. Identification of secondary metabolites present in the barley leaves was performed using the HPLC-MS system consisting of Agilent 1100 HPLC instrument (Palo Alto, CA, USA) with the XBridge C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m particle size). Flow rate was 0.2 ml\/min and the gradient: 0-6 min from 8 to 10% B, 6-40 min to 20% B; 40-46 min to 98% B. After 52 min solvent composition returned to starting conditions and equilibration of system was achieved at 65 min.","Mass spec: Ion trap mass spectrometer (Esquire 3000, Bruker, Germany) with electrospray ionization coupled to a high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and UV detector (Agilent 1100) HPLC\/PDA-ESI\/MSn was used for the qualitative analysis of phenolic compounds in negative and positive mode. The spectra were acquired in the range of 50-3000 m\/z. The spectrometer was controlled by software Esquire Software version 5, and data were analyzed using software DataAnalysis version 5 in the package supplied by Bruker.","Data transformation: The chromatographic UPLC-UV data concerning all drought variants submitted for joint analysis were in the form of (retention time x wavelength x sample) table, with 10 801 retention times, 2 wavelengths, and 547 samples. They were processed using our own R-scripts in the following way: a) Normalization: the raw data were normalized by mass of samples, which means that every single chromatogram value was divided by the mass of the appropriate extracted leaf sample. b) Baseline removal: chromatographic baselines need to be removed since they can negatively affect the alignment and ultimately the results of the data analysis. Therefore baselines were removed using the numerical differentiation without their explicit estimation. c) Retention time alignment: the correlation optimized warping (COW) was chosen for this purpose. This method operates on the entire chromatograms prior to the peak detection (see point d); it aligns profiles by matching their shapes and compressing or expanding time intervals, whereas the peak height and area are generally unaffected. d) Peak detection: peaks are here interpreted as the retention time intervals in which some kind of metabolite or a group of metabolites with similar chromatographic properties occurs. Peaks within individual chromatograms were detected using profiles of the second derivative; since the second derivative is usually characterized by a high noise, it was smoothed by a cubic smoothing spline. The inflection points were located to find boundaries for the individual peaks and peaks common for several (or all) chromatograms were built. Such defined peaks are not equivalent to chromatographic peaks present in different individual chromatograms as sometimes they cover several peaks (usually with small intensity). ","Metabolite id: The individual compounds were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention times to these of standard compounds and literature data. Several compounds were isolated from barley leaves on a preparative scale and purified using the flash chromatography on a polyamide column followed by preparative HPLC on reversed phase C18 column. Structures of the purified compounds were established using 1H, 13C, COSY, NOESY, HMBC, HSQC NMR spectra."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS52","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS52","title":"Profiles of phenolic secondary metabolites in plants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)","date":"2014-11-20","timestamp":1416441600,"submitter":["Aneta Sawikowska","Anna Piasecka","Piotr Kachlicki","Pawe\u0142 Krajewski"],"publications":[{"title":"Profiles of phenolic secondary metabolites in plants of barley (Hordeum vulgare L.)","doi":"","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Bruker Daltonics esquire 3000","organism":"Hordeum vulgare","organism_parts":"leaf","metabolites":["tricin 7-O-glucoside|tricin 7-O-[sinapoyl]-glucoside","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-methoxycaffeoyl]-glucoside 2","UPLC_UV_signal_040","UPLC_UV_signal_041","UPLC_UV_signal_045","UPLC_UV_signal_046","UPLC_UV_signal_020","UPLC_UV_signal_021","sinapoyl-isovitexin 2''-O-arabinoside","sinapoyl-isoscoparin 2''-O-arabinoside","UPLC_UV_signal_029","UPLC_UV_signal_034","UPLC_UV_signal_043","isoscoparin 2''-O-arabinoside","UPLC_UV_signal_012","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-acidic derivative]-glucoside 2","chrysoeriol 7-O-diglucoside","isovitexin 7-O-[sinapoyl]-glucoside","isovitexin 7-O-[feruloyl]-glucoside","UPLC_UV_signal_017","sinapoyl-isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside 2","chrysoeriol 7-O-[6''-coumaroyl]-glucoside","UPLC_UV_signal_047","hordatine B derivative 1","hordatine A derivative","sinapoyl - hexose 1","UPLC_UV_signal_007","sinapic acid derivative 1","hordatine B derivative 2","caffeic acid derivative","isoorientin 7-O-glucoside","sinapoylquinic acid 2","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-methoxycaffeoyl]-glucoside 1","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-acidic derivative]- glucoside 1","isoorientin 7-O-[6''-feruloyl]-glucoside","isoorientin 7-O-[6''-sinapoyl]-glucoside|unidentified","isoscoparin 2''-O-glucoside and Isovitexin","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-sinapoyl]-glucoside","UPLC_UV_signal_013","isoscoparin 7-O-[6''-sinapoyl]-glucoside","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-feruloyl]-glucoside","chrysoeriol 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside and luteolin 7-O-arabinosylglucoside","isovitexin 7-O-[6''-feruloyl]-glucoside 4''-acidic derivative","UPLC_UV_signal_049","hordatine B","hordatine A","sinapoyl-isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside 1","feruloyl-isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside","apigenin 7-O-arabinosylglucoside|apigenin 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside","UPLC_UV_signal_051","isovitexin 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside","luteolin 6-C-arabinoside 8-C-glucoside","apigenin 6-C-glucoside-8-C-arabinoside","isovitexin 7-O-glucoside (saponarin)","isoorientin 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside","isoscoparin 7-O-glucoside|isovitexin 7-O-[6''-sinapoyl]-glucoside 4'-O-glucoside","isovitexin 8-C-glucoside","isovitexin 2''-O-glucoside|isoscoparin 7-O-rhamnosylglucoside","isovitexin 2''-O-arabinoside","UPLC_UV_signal_001","UPLC_UV_signal_002","p-coumaroylquinic acid","UPLC_UV_signal_003","UPLC_UV_signal_004","sinapoylquinic acid 1","UPLC_UV_signal_005","caffeoylquinic acid","UPLC_UV_signal_006","UPLC_UV_signal_008","UPLC_UV_signal_009","sinapoyl-tricin 7-O-glucoside","sinapoyl - hexose 2","sinapic acid derivative 2","UPLC_UV_signal_010","UPLC_UV_signal_011","sinapic acid derivative 3","p-coumaric acid derivative","agmatine derivative","UPLC_UV_signal_014","UPLC_UV_signal_015","UPLC_UV_signal_016","UPLC_UV_signal_018","UPLC_UV_signal_019","tricin 7-O-[sinapoyl]-glucoside 4'-O-glucoside","UPLC_UV_signal_022","UPLC_UV_signal_023","UPLC_UV_signal_024","UPLC_UV_signal_025","UPLC_UV_signal_026","UPLC_UV_signal_027","UPLC_UV_signal_028","UPLC_UV_signal_030","UPLC_UV_signal_031","UPLC_UV_signal_032","UPLC_UV_signal_033","UPLC_UV_signal_035","UPLC_UV_signal_036","UPLC_UV_signal_037","UPLC_UV_signal_038","UPLC_UV_signal_039","UPLC_UV_signal_042","UPLC_UV_signal_044","UPLC_UV_signal_048","UPLC_UV_signal_050"]}},"MTBLS117":{"description":["Here we present a metabolic profiling strategy employing direct infusion Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC\/MS) for the monitoring of soybean's (Glycine max L.) global metabolism regulation in response to Rhizoctonia solani infection in a time-course. Key elements in the approach are the construction of a comprehensive metabolite library for soybean, which accelerates the steps of metabolite identification and biological interpretation of results, and bioinformatics tools for the visualization and analysis of its metabolome. The study of metabolic networks revealed that infection results in the mobilization of carbohydrates, disturbance of the amino acid pool, and activation of isoflavonoid, \u03b1-linolenate and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways. Components of these pathways include phytoalexins, coumarins, flavonoids, signaling molecules, and hormones, many of which exhibit antioxidant properties and bioactivity helping the plant to counterattack the pathogen's invasion. Unraveling the biochemical mechanism operating during soybean-Rhizoctonia interaction in addition to its significance towards the understanding of the plant's metabolism regulation under biotic stress, provides valuable insights with potential for applications in biotechnology, crop breeding, and agrochemical and food industries.","Sample collection: Seeds of the soybean cultivar AC Proteina (Semican, Plessisville, QC, Canada), which is susceptible to R. solani, were sterilized by immersion in ethanol (70%, v\/v) for 1 min, followed by rinsing three times in sterile distilled water. For pre-germination, seeds were placed on sterilized moistened filter paper (Whatman No 1, 11 cm diameter) in Petri plates, and kept at 24 \u00b0C in the dark. Uniformly pre-germinated seeds were planted in sterile mix of turf:perlite (1:1, v\/v) in plastic trays in the dark in a growth chamber at 22\u00b12 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 85%. Sterile water was added every second day. Seedlings were etiolated in order to provide longer lengths of hypocotyls for inoculation. They were grown for one week to approximately 15 cm height before they were gently removed and inoculated. For the production of the inoculum, starter cultures of the highly pathogenic R. solani AG4 isolate A76, provided by M. Cubeta (N. Carolina University, USA), were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for three days. Uniform and healthy one-week-old seedlings were transferred to sterile Pyrex glass trays (38 x 27 x 6 cm) on filter paper (Whatman No 1), arranged horizontally, and their roots were covered with sterile moistened cotton. For the analysis of hyphae, the fungus was grown on cellophane membrane. Inoculation was performed by sandwiching hypocotyls between two PDA strips (2 cm x 8 cm) of 3-day-old Rhizoctonia cultures or clean strips (control) in sterile environment under photosynthetically inactive black light (365 nm) on designated marked sites of the hypocotyls, 3 cm away from the roots. Trays were wrapped with plastic membrane, and returned to growth chambers for incubation at 24 \u00b0C, in the dark. The development of necrotic lesions was stereoscopically observed and plants were harvested 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, and prepared for metabolite extraction. These time points were specifically chosen in order to capture the onset of infection and the development of infection cushions. Each treatment (infected or control) was consisted of five biological replications, each obtained by pooling the hypocotyls of four seedlings. Samples (100 mg of fresh weight, fw) were harvested from the edges of necrotic lesions at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation and corresponding portions of control seedlings. Additionally, mycelia (50 mg, fw) from 3 day old R. solani cultures were harvested. Samples were pulverized to a fine powder in a mortar with a pestle under liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00baC in glass autosampler vials (2 ml) until further processing.","Extraction: 1 ml of a mixture of methanol:ethyl acetate (50:50, v\/v) was added to the pulverized samples followed by sonication in an ultrasonic bath Branson 5510 (Branson, Connecticut, USA) for 25 min. Samples were then transferred to an orbital shaker (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland) for extraction under continuous agitation (150 rpm) for 2 h at 24 \u00baC. Extracts were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m filters (Millex-FG, Millipore, MA, USA) to remove debris and the volume of samples was adjusted to 1.0 ml. 0.5 ml of the extract was taken in a glass autosampler vial for direct infusion Orbitrap MS analysis (DIMS). The extracts were sub-divided into equal portions of 0.25 ml for analysis in positive (ESI+) and negative (ESI-) electrospray modes, respectively. Finally, extracts were dried using a Labconco CentriVap refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) equipped with a cold trap.","Chromatography: No chromatography was carried out.","Mass spec: For analyses in ESI+, 160 \u00b5l of a mixture of methanol:formic acid (0.1% v\/v) (50-50, v\/v) were added to the dried samples, whereas for analyses in ESI-, 160 \u00b5l of methanol:ammonium acetate (2.5 mM) were added. Finally, extracts were transferred into microinserters, which were consecutively placed in glass autosampler vials. An LTQ-Orbitrap MS Classic (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) mass spectrometer was employed and experimental events were controlled by the software Xcalibur v.2.2 (Thermo Scientific). The analyzer was equipped with a quadrupole linear ion trap, an Orbitrap electrostatic Fourier transform mass spectrometer (FTMS) with a heated electrospray ionization probe (HESI-II, Thermo Scientific), and an Accela pump (Thermo Scientific). The source voltage was set to 3.2 kV (ESI+) and 4.0 kV (ESI-) and the capillary voltage to 5.0 V (ESI+) and -35 V (ESI-). The capillary temperature was set to 275 \u00baC. Sheath gas flow was set to 10 (ESI+), and 20 (ESI-) whereas no auxiliary and sweep gases were used. Samples (10 \u00b5l) were injected manually performing direct infusion at a flow rate of 10 \u00b5l\/min using a 100 \u00b5l syringe (Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). DIMS analysis was performed at a mass resolution of 60,000 at m\/z 400 and spectra were acquired over the range of 50-1,800 Da for 3.5 min. For selected samples MS\/MS analyses were performed with the normalized collision energy set at 35 eV, the activation q set to 0.25 and the activation time to 30 ms. Target ions already selected for MS\/MS were dynamically excluded for 15 s. AGC target value was set to 5E^5 for the Orbitrap and to 1E^4 for the MS\/MS analysis in the linear ion trap. For each treatment, a quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 25 \u00b5l from each of the five biological replicates (total 125 \u00b5l), and analyzed. In addition to biological replications and QC samples, technical one replication for randomly selected samples was performed per treatment. Following each sample's analysis, a blank (solvent system only) was injected to ensure that no carry over is observed between samples. Additionally, blank samples were used for the detection of possible contamination during the different experimental steps, such as material and reagent impurities. For this purpose, 1.5 ml of the extraction solvent mixture was processed alongside the experimental samples and was subjected to identical handling. Results were taken into account for the detection of metabolites not related to the biological material that was analyzed, which were subsequently excluded from analyses. Additionally, the metabolic composition of fungal samples was taken into consideration, in order to remove fungal-derived metabolites that could influence the biological interpretation of results. In order to optimize the performance of analyzers, calibration was performed at the beginning of analyses following the recommended by the manufacturers' procedures and using calibration solutions. For Orbitrap MS, the ProteoMass ESI Calibration Kit MSCAL5 (Sigma-Aldrich), which covers the range between 138 and 1822 Da, was used for ESI+ analyses. For ESI-, calibration was performed using the ProteoMass ESI Calibration Kit MSCAL6 (Sigma-Aldrich), which covers the range between 265 to 1880 Da. Internal standards were not used but instead, mass errors were estimated based on accurate masses of common identified metabolites such as amino (ESI+) and lipid (ESI-) acids.","Data transformation: Acquired data (*.raw format) were processed using the software SIEVE v1.3 (Thermo Scientific) installed in a 12-core 64-bit PC workstation (Windows 7 Ultimate SP1, Intel Core\u2122 i7 CPU, 24 GB RAM). Although the software is designed for the analysis of LC\/MS data, with appropriate changes in the settings, we were able to analyse data obtained by DIMS. The acquired mass spectra between 0.6 and 1.2 min were processed. Obtained frames [rectangular regions of m\/z vs retention time (RT)] were filtered based on their coefficient of variation distribution (CV) in the reconstructed ion chromatograms (RIC). Frame intensities were normalized to the total ion chromatogram (TIC) and frames with CV>0.5 were excluded from further analysis. The obtained data matrices were exported to Simca P+, after the removal of peaks corresponding to isotopes, for multivariate analyses.","Metabolite id: In order to develop a high-throughput metabolomics protocol, identification was performed following a biologically-driven approach. Central to this approach is the species-specific in-house built library for soybean composed of 1339 metabolites, which includes information on metabolite monoisotopic mass, molecular formula, biosynthetic pathways, and chemical classification. For the construction of the library, information was retrieved from the publicly available databases of SoyCyc, KEGG, EMBL-EBI, KNApSAcK, and the literature. For standardization purposes, the KEGG coding system for pathways was adapted, which enables the comprehensive grouping of pathways and is compatible with bioinformatics tools such as the pathway tools of BioCyc. For the chemical classification of metabolites, information was retrieved from the database PubChem. For Orbitrap MS analyses, using the software SIEVE, searches for the constructed frames were performed against the constructed library with a mass error (deltappm) <2 ppm. Putative identification of metabolites was based on mass accuracy and, where available, MS\/MS fragmentation and isotope patterns, following heuristic rules [1]. MS\/MS spectra deconvolution was performed using the software MetWorks 1.3 SP3 and Mass Frontier 7.0 SR1 (Thermo Scientific). Ref: [1] Kind T, Fiehn O.

Nevertheless, the direct and indirect effects of climate change on their metabolic functioning remain poorly understood. Here, we use metabolomics, the unbiased study of multiple low molecular weight organic metabolites, to examine how the physiology of Calanus spp. is affected by end-of-century global warming and ocean acidification scenarios. We report that the physiological stresses associated with incubation without food over a 5-day period greatly exceed those caused directly by seawater temperature or pH perturbations. This highlights the need to contextualise the results of climate change experiments by comparison to other, naturally occurring stressors such as food deprivation, which is being exacerbated by global warming. Protein and lipid metabolism were up-regulated in the food-deprived animals, with a novel class of taurine-containing lipids and the essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, changing significantly over the duration of our experiment. Copepods derive these PUFAs by ingesting diatoms and flagellated microplankton respectively. Climate-driven changes in the productivity, phenology and composition of microplankton communities, and hence the availability of these fatty acids, therefore have the potential to influence the ability of copepods to survive starvation and other environmental stressors.","Sample collection: Our fully factorial experiment compared the metabolic profiles of 10 replicate groups of 5 wild-caught Calanus spp. stage 5 copepodites (so-called \u2018CVs\u2019) acclimated to 8 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C in 0.2 \u00b5m filtered seawater (FSW) to those of replicate groups of CVs incubated in FSW at 8 \u00b0C or 10 \u00b0C that had been equilibrated to ambient air, containing ~380 \u00b5atm pCO2 (ambient hereafter), or air enriched to 1000 \u00b5atm pCO2, for a period of 5 days in the absence of food (6 treatment regimes, n=10 each, total n=60). CO2-enriched air was commercially produced to order (BOC Special Gases, UK). Experimental animals were collected off Stonehaven, NE Scotland (56\u00b057.80N, 02\u00b006.20W) on 23 May 2011 using a 1 m ring net fitted with a 250 \u00b5m mesh net and non-filtering cod-end. The percentage abundance of C. helgolandicus:C. finmarchicus was 55:45 at the time of sampling. Zooplankton were gently concentrated onto a 45 \u00b5m mesh and 60 replicate groups of 5 Calanus spp. CVs were carefully picked into FSW; 30 of these replicates were acclimated to each of the two temperature regimes in ambient FSW for 72 hrs prior to experimentation. We chose to work with CVs to ensure that eggs were not available as a potential food source during our experiment. No attempts were made to distinguish between live C. helgolandicus and C. finmarchicus (Calanus spp. hereafter) because it is not possible to reliably achieve this without inflicting severe stress and\/or killing the animals. At the outset of the experiment (t0), 10 replicate groups of 5 animals from the two temperatures were individually concentrated onto a 45 \u00b5m mesh, rapidly transferred into Precellys homogenisation tubes (Stretton Scientific, UK) and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental setup was conceptually similar to that described previously[1]. Experimental animals were transferred into 500 ml egg production chambers containing FSW at the prescribed temperature and CO2 level, topped up with the appropriate FSW (ambient or 1000 \u00b5atm pCO2) and sealed with an air-tight lid to avoid CO2 out-gassing. These were incubated for 24 hrs and subsequently transferred into fresh FSW at the same temperature and CO2 level after each 24 hr incubation period for a total of 5 days. The experiment was conducted in the absence of food to simultaneously examine the effects of food deprivation. This also avoided any confounding effects of feeding differences between the treatments. At the end of the experiment (t5) animals were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen as described above. All samples were stored frozen at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. The pH of the incubation water was measured at the start and end of each 24-hr period using a Hanna bench top meter (H1859) following calibration using reference standards at pH 4, 7 and 10 (Sigma, UK). Average pH values of the ambient and CO2-acidified experimental seawater were 8.09 \u00b1 0.03 (sd) and 7.76 \u00b1 0.08, respectively; values did not differ between the temperature treatments (F=0.616, df=1, p=0.4337) or between the start and end of each 24 hr incubation period (F=0.100, df=1, p=0.7522).

","Extraction: Metabolites were extracted from each sample, using a two-step methanol\/water\/chloroform protocol. In brief, 100 \u00b5l methanol (HPLC grade) and 40 \u00b5l water per copepod were added to each sample prior to homogenization using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogenizer (Stretton Scientific, UK). Thereafter, 50 \u00b5l water and 100 \u00b5l chloroform per copepod were added to each sample, which was vortexed and centrifuged (1800 rcf, 10 min, 4 \u00baC), yielding an upper (polar) and lower (non-polar) fraction for each sample. Each polar fraction was collected into a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, and the non-polar fraction into a 1.8 ml glass vial. Extraction blanks were also prepared using identical methods except that no biological material was added to the solvents. Two quality control samples were pooled from polar and nonpolar extracts, respectively. All polar samples were dried in a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY), the nonpolar samples under a stream of nitrogen gas. All samples were stored at -80 \u00baC prior to analysis.","Chromatography: Not applicable.","Mass spec: Direct infusion mass spectrometry data acquisition in the positive ion mode was performed on a LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a chip-based Advion Triversa direct infusion nanoelectrospray source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). The polar extracts designated for this ion mode were each taken up in 100 \u00b5l of 0.25% formic acid in methanol\/water 4:1. Samples were centrifuged (10 min, 22000 rcf, 4 \u00baC) to remove any particular matter. They were run in a controlled-randomized sequence different from the extraction sequence, in three technical replicates which followed each other immediately. QC samples were run in the beginning, the end, and equidistantly throughout the sequence. Data was acquired at nominal 1E5 resolution from m\/z 70-590, in 7 wide SIM (selected ion monitoring) windows. Nonpolar (lipid) samples were taken up in the original volume of methanol\/chloroform 3:1, containing 5 % ammonium acetate. Data were acquired in increasing SIM windows of 100 Da to 200 Da width, from m\/z 120 to 1200.","Data transformation: Raw mass spectral data were processed using the SIM-stitching algorithm (scripts available on request), using an in-house Matlab script.","Metabolite id: The data matrices were normalized using the PQN algorithm. Missing values were imputed into the resulting data matrix using the KNN algorithm via an in-house R script. This matrix would be used for univariate statistics. The matrix was transformed using the generalised logarithm to stabilise the variance across the measured peaks prior to analysis with multivariate statistics. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used initially to assess the overall metabolic differences between the sample groups in an unbiased manner, using the PLS Toolbox (version 5.5.1, Eigenvector Research, Manson, WA, USA) within Matlab (version 7.8; The MathsWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The significance of any group separation along individual principal components was tested using ANOVA and Tukey posthoc tests. Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), a form of supervised multivariate analysis, was performed using the PLS Toolbox, with internal cross-validation (Venetian blinds). The optimal number of latent variables was determined by minimising the classification error and the significance of the predictive models using in-house MatLab scripts. Student t-tests, corrected for a 5% false discovery rate (FDR, Benjamini-Hochberg) using in-house R scripts, were used to confirm the significance of changes in individual mass spectral signals. Corrected p values are reported here as q values. Signals were putatively annotated with empirical formulae calculated by the MIPack software[1], searching the KEGG[2][3] and LipidMaps[4][5] databases, and confirmed by performing calculations based on the original spectra in Xcalibur 2.0.7 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Many signals that contributed significantly to distinguishing the metabolic profiles of individual treatment groups could not be identified by the combination of database and empirical formula searches. Consequently, further identification of selected metabolites was performed using mass spectrometry (same instrument as above). This utilised wide SIM windows and the m\/z values of identified signals for additional high mass accuracy measurement of unknown signals, narrow SIM (nSIM) windows at up to 4E5 nominal resolution for the determination of isotope patterns, and MSn fragmentation using collision-induced dissociation (CID) and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD).

In particular, label-free quantification based on LC-MS is easily amenable to large-scale studies and thus well suited to clinical metabolomics. Large-scale studies, however, require automated processing of the large and complex LC-MS datasets. <\/p> We present a novel algorithm for the detection of mass traces and their aggregation into features (i.e. all signals caused by the same analyte species) that is computationally efficient and sensitive and that leads to reproducible quantification results. The algorithm is based on a sensitive detection of mass traces, which are then assembled into features based on mass-to-charge spacing, co-elution information, and a support vector machine\u2013based classifier able to identify potential metabolite isotope patterns. The algorithm is not limited to metabolites but is applicable to a wide range of small molecules (e.g. lipidomics, peptidomics), as well as to other separation technologies. <\/p> We assessed the algorithm's robustness with regard to varying noise levels on synthetic data and then validated the approach on experimental data investigating human plasma samples. We obtained excellent results in a fully automated data-processing pipeline with respect to both accuracy and reproducibility. Relative to state-of-the art algorithms, ours demonstrated increased precision and recall of the method. The algorithm is available as part of the open-source software package OpenMS and runs on all major operating systems. <\/p> See MTBLS235 for the simulated part of this study.","Sample collection: All aqueous solutions were prepared using LC-MS-grade water from Chromosolv\u00ae, Fluka Analytical (Sigma-Aldrich, Munich, Germany).

The Populus root microbiome is a diverse community that has high abundance of \u03b2- and \u03b3-Proteobacteria, both classes which include multiple plant-growth promoting representatives. To understand the contribution of individual microbiome members in a community, we studied the function of a simplified community consisting of Pseudomonas and Burkholderia bacterial strains isolated from Populus hosts and inoculated on axenic Populus cutting in controlled laboratory conditions. Both strains increased lateral root formation and root hair production in Arabidopsis plate assays and are predicted to encode for different functions related to growth and plant growth promotion in Populus hosts. Inoculation individually, with either bacterial isolate, increased root growth relative to uninoculated controls, and while root area was increased in mixed inoculation, the interaction term was insignificant indicating additive effects of root phenotype. Complementary data including photosynthetic efficiency, whole-transcriptome gene expression and GC-MS metabolite expression data in individual and mixed inoculated treatments indicate that the effects of these bacterial strains are unique and additive. These results suggest that the function of a microbiome community may be predicted from the additive functions of the individual members.","Sample collection: Bacterial and plant culture:Pseudomonas GM41 and Burkholderia sp. BT03 bacterial strains were isolated using 3 rounds of colony-restreaking on rich medium (R2A, Franklin Lakes, BD Difco, NJ, USA) agar plates from surface-sterilized Populus deltoides roots from plants growing near the Caney Fork river in central Tennessee, USA[1].

The supernatant was discarded and the cells suspended in 1 ml freezing medium (50% FCS, 40% culture medium and 10% DMSO). The freezing medium acts as cryoprotectant allowing for maintenance of cell integrity. After transfer into cryo vials, the samples were frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. For each cell line and each time point (24 h and 72 h), 8 control samples and 10 drug incubated samples were prepared yielding a total of 108 cell samples, each containing approximately 1\u20135*10^6 cells for NMR analysis. Trypan blue exclusion assay At each time point, the amount of living cells was assessed with the Trypan blue exclusion assay to yield the number of living versus dead cells. This assay can be used as a measure of cell membrane integrity. For the assay, the cells were briefly incubated with a solution of 0.4% (w\/v) Trypan blue dye in PBS and counted in an automated cell counter (Countess automated cell counter, Life Technologies Europe B.V.). Cell viability was expressed as the percentage of living cells (dye-excluding) relative to the total number of cells. The cell viabilities of the thawed cell samples right before NMR measurement were found to be between 84% and 99% for all three cell lines and were not significantly different from freshly harvested cells.","Sample collection: Before NMR analysis, each frozen cell sample was thawed at 37 \u00b0C, transferred into 2.5 ml preheated culture medium and centrifuged at 2000 rcf for 5 min. The supernatant was discarded and the cells were washed three times with 1 ml PBS. After the last washing step, the cells were taken up in 20 \u00b5l 10 mM D2O-based PBS (pH 7.4). The cell suspension was transferred into a standard 4 mm MAS rotor using a 12 \u00b5l insert. All cell samples were measured in a random order. For each cell line, the NMR spectral profile was unaffected by the freezing and thawing procedure as compared to freshly harvested cells.","Nmr spec: The 1H HR-MAS NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer (Bruker BioSpin) operating at a resonance frequency of 500.13 MHz for 1H. The instrument is equipped with a 4 mm HR-MAS dual inverse 1H\/13C probe (Bruker BioSpin) with a Magic Angle gradient. All experiments were carried out at a magic angle (54.7\u00b0) spinning rate of 3 kHz and a stabilized temperature of 310 K. The Bruker Topspin software (version 2.1, patch level 5) was used to acquire the NMR data.","Nmr assay: For each sample, two 1D 1H HR-MAS NMR spectra were recorded both with presaturation of the water resonance applying a 1D NOESY and a 1D cpmg sequence for suppressing resonances with short T2 relaxation times (\u201cnoesypr1d\u201d and \u201ccpmgpr1d\u201d respectively from the Bruker pulse-program library). Each 1D 1H NMR spectrum was acquired applying 512 (for noesy1d) or 1024 (for cpmg1d) transients, a spectral width of 6002.4 Hz, a data size of 32 K points, an acquisition time of 2.73 s, and a relaxation delay of 4 s (for noesy1d) or 2s (for cpmg1d). The 90\u00b0 pulse length was 8.7 \u00b5s, the noesy mixing time 10 ms and the echo time applied for the cpmg-spectra was 9.6 ms (16 loops, rotor-synchronized interpulse delay of 0.3 ms). The total experiment time for acquiring both 1D spectra was about 2.5 h. During this time period, MAS spinning at 3kHz had little effect on the NMR spectroscopic profile of the cell samples as could be established from preceding time-dependent measurements. In addition, all samples were measured following a strict timely constant protocol. For selected samples (from both, the control and drug-treated groups at each time point) phase-sensitive 2D 1H1H-TOCSY spectra using the DIPSI2 sequence for mixing and 2D J-resolved spectra (\u201cdipsi2phpr\u201d and \u201cjresgpprqf\u201d, respectively, from the Bruker pulse program library) both with presaturation during relaxation delay were recorded to help spectral assignment.","Data transformation: Spectral processing was performed using the Bruker Topspin software (version 3.2, patch level 3). The co-added free induction decays (FIDs) were exponentially weighted with a line broadening factor of 1.0 Hz, Fourier-transformed, and manually phase corrected to obtain the 1H NMR spectra. Each spectrum was manually baseline corrected using a cubic spline interpolation method according to selected baseline points. Chemical shifts were referenced to the phosphocholine (PC) signal at d = 3.23 ppm for A2780 and HEK-293 cell samples and to the creatine (Cre) signal at d = 3.05 ppm for the A2780cisR cell samples.","Metabolite id: Multi- and univariate statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB R2012a (Mathworks), PLS-Toolbox 7.5.2 (Eigenvector Research, Inc.), and Excel 2010 (Microsoft). Prior to data analysis, four 1H HR-MAS NMR cell spectra were excluded out of the total of 108 spectra, because their signal to noise ratio was too low leaving a total of 104 spectra. The 1D NOESY spectra were used for multivariate analysis of the spectral regions between 0 and 6.5 ppm, while single resonances in the spectral region between 5 and 9 ppm were evaluated based on the 1D cpmg spectra."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS156","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS156","title":"1H HR-MAS NMR Based Metabolic Profiling of Cells in Response to Treatment with a Hexacationic Ruthenium Metallaprism as Potential Anticancer Drug","date":"2015-01-16","timestamp":1421366400,"submitter":["Martina Vermathen"],"publications":[{"title":"1H HR-MAS NMR based Metabolic Profiling of Cells in Response to Treatment with a Hexacationic Ruthenium Metallaprism as Potential Anticancer Drug","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0128478","pubmed":"PMID:26024484"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Bruker","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"A2780 cell","metabolites":["Cholesterol","Lipid","Isoleucine","leucine","Valine","L-Lactic acid","L-threonine","lysine","L-alanine","Acetate","L-glutamine","UDP-GlcNAc","UDP-N-Acetyl-galactosamine","Glutathione","glutamate","Creatine","Choline","Phosphocholine","Phosphoethanolamine","Glycerophosphocholine","myo-Inositol","Ribose 5-phosphate","uridine-diphosphate","UTP","D-glucosamine","glucose 1-phosphate","Udp glucuronic acid","Uracil","Uridine","Cytidine","tyrosine(.)","L-phenylalanine","AMP"]}},"MTBLS114":{"description":["Caloric restriction increases life-span of a number of organisms. The relationship between the increase in life-span and the extent of caloric restriction, however, varies among species. The underlying mechanisms are yet unknown, but appear to be related to changes in metabolism. In order to investigate the metabolic response of caloric restriction of rats, here is presented the first nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy-based study of how blood metabolite profiles are influenced by graded levels of caloric restriction. The study involved three groups of obese rats exposed to 0, 20, and 40% caloric restriction for five days. Blood serum from each individual was analyzed by 1H NMR and the resulting spectra were subjected to multivariate analysis by unsupervised principal component analysis and supervised orthogonal-partial least square discriminant analysis. The analyzes revealed that a response to caloric restriction was present at 20% caloric restriction. The metabolites that distinguished the profiles at 20% restriction deviated from those at 40% restriction. The changes induced by caloric restriction were most clearly observed as an increased level of 3-hydroxybutyrate, and decreased levels of lipids and pyruvate. The metabolic responses of rats exposed to caloric restriction are in good agreement with a switch in metabolism from anabolic pathways towards fatty acid catabolism and gluconeogenesis, which is consistent with previous observations for mice.","Sample collection: Diet-induced obesity was established in 13 month old female Wistar rats (Scanbur AB, Sollentuna, Sweden) by providing free access to a high energy diet for three months as previously described [1]. Water was freely available at all times. The rats were subjected to a 12\/12 hr light\/dark regime, and the room temperature was held between 20 and 23 \u00b0C. The rats were later randomly allocated to one of two groups (n = 5), receiving 20 or 40% caloric restriction. Food rations were calculated from the baseline food consumption prior to the restriction period. A third group (n = 5) continued to receive food in unrestricted amounts (0% caloric restriction) and served as controls. Caloric restriction was sustained for five days after which the rats were decapitated. Blood serum was prepared by allowing blood to clot before being centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 20 min. Serum was stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Ref: [1] Malmlof, K., N. Din, T. Johansen, and S. B. Pedersen. 2002.

Spectra were recorded using 512 transients with 32k data points and a spectral width of 6410 Hz. Water suppression was achieved by irradiation during the relaxation delay of 3 s.","Data transformation: All spectra were processed with Topspin 2.0 (Bruker). A zero-filling factor of 2 and a line-broadening of 0.5 Hz were applied to the spectra. Phasing was done automatically, followed by manual phasing if necessary, and baseline correction was automatically performed by subtraction of a polynomial of 5th degree. The signal of the anomeric proton of alpha-glucose was used as a reference (delta 5.233 ppm).","Metabolite id: Spectral signals were assigned by comparison of chemical shifts with values from the literature ([1][2][3][4] and from the Chenomx library (Chenomx NMR Suite 7.5, Chenomx Inc., Alberta, US). In order to support the assignment of metabolite signals, 1H,1H-TOCSY (total correlation spectroscopy) and 1H,13C- HSQC (heteronuclear single-quantum coherence) were run on selected samples, which were then fortified with expected metabolites.

The community\u2019s metabolic potential can be assessed using metatranscriptomics, which is a measure of gene expression in the environment. More recently, advances in metabolomics deliver details on specific organic compounds found in the environment. While the integration of these two datasets is desirable, the vast data streams can hinder investigations into biological and chemical processes. Here, we use data in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) combined with K means clustering to jointly interrogate metabolomics and metatranscriptomics data collected from a coastal marine environment. Using KEGG allowed us to focus our analysis on genes and compounds connected by a defined biochemical reaction. The K means clustering provided an unbiased means to place metabolites and genes into groups based on their temporal variability. Each of the groups defined by the K means clustering contained both transcripts and metabolites, which emphasized the interconnected nature of these two datasets. While conceptually simple, this analysis allowed us to explore a tractable number of biochemical pathways within our data. Continued development of computational tools to analyze meta-omics data is a pressing need. The application of tools such as described here is an exciting step towards integrated multi-omics data analysis that can be used to address broad questions in biogeochemical cycling.","Sample collection: Surface seawater was collected and filtered from Narragansett Bay (41\u00b034'12'' N, 71\u00b023'24'' W) on five different days in 2012 (May 16, May 21, May 30, June 4, June 8; [1]). Each water sample was 2 l and triplicate water samples were processed at each time point.

Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v\/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g\/ml) as an internal standard. For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg\/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile. Ref: [1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E. Acidic acetonitrile for cellular metabolome extraction from Escherichia coli.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng\/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.

This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite. For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS).

Untargeted metabolomics data Data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m\/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps.

Two further QC sample runs were performed using data dependent acquisition (MSMS) of the most intense ions in the negative and positive ion modes, respectively, at a nominal resolution of 50,000.","Data transformation: DIMS: Data processing was performed using NBAF-B in-house scripts in MatLab. During replicate filtering, Ppeaks were allowed if found in two out of three technical replicates and the blank filter required biological signals to be 2x the height of background signals. Sample filtering with 2 ppm error and a 75% filter resulted in a matrix containing 2044 peaks (m\/z values) (see DIMS_SFPM.xlsx). LC-MS: The intensity matrix was imported into our SIMStitch pipeline immediately after the replicate filter, and hence included blank and sample filtering as for DIMS processing above (see LCMS_SFPM.xlsx). Additional compound identification (DI-MS\/MS and MSn) was performed on the same instrument and is reported in the publication. Normalisation: Probabilistic quotient normalization (PQN) normalisation using in-house Matlab script, followed by filling missing values in the resulting data matrix using the knn algorithm (k=5) (see DIMS_SFPM_norm.xlsx and LCMS_SFPM_norm.xlsx). G-log transformation: Scaling by G-log transform optimisation using in-house Matlab script (see DIMS_SFPM_glog.xlsx and LCMS_SFPM_glog.xlsx). LC-MS data conversion: LCMS: RPLC-FT-ICR-MS lipidomics data were initially converted into netcdf (.cdf) format using Xcalibur 2.1. XCMS conversion: Netcdf files are processed using an R based XCMS script  library(Hmisc)  library(xcms)  library(CAMERA)  xset <- xcmsSet(step=0.02,snthresh=5,mzdiff = 0.01)  grp <- group(xset,bw=10,mzwid = 0.05)  xsa <- annotate(grp, cor_eic_th=0)  peaklist<-getPeaklist(xsa)  write.csv(peaklist,'Sinkins_LCMSneg_a.csv') to generate an intensity matrix with a list of peak retention times (see LCMS_XCMSoutput.xlsx). All the Excel (.xlsx) files referenced above can be found within the study folder.","Metabolite id: Putative annotations were complemented with LC-MS\/MS, DIMS\/MS and MSn data.

patient triage and treatment decisions. To identify biomarkers that distinguish patients with CAP from non-CAP controls, we conducted an untargeted global metabolome analysis for plasma samples from142 patients with CAP (CAP cases) and 97 without CAP (non-CAP controls). Thirteen lipid metabolites could discriminate between CAP cases and non-CAP controls with area-under-the-receiver-operating-characteristic curve of > 8 (P \u2264 10-9). The levels of glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelins, lysophosphatidylcholines and L-palmitoylcarnitine were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower in the CAP cases than those in non-CAP controls. All 13 metabolites could distinguish CAP cases from the non-infection, extrapulmonary infection and non-CAP respiratory tract infection subgroups. The levels of trihexosylceramide (d18:1\/16:0) were higher, while the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamines were lower, in the fatal than those of non-fatal CAP cases. Our \ufb01ndings suggest that lipid metabolites are potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for CAP.","Sample collection: This study included patients admitted to Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong between 2007 and 2013. Archived plasma samples collected at admission were retrieved for metabolomics study. CAP cases were hospitalized adult patients 18 years or above with radiological evidence of consolidation within 48 hours of admission and at least one of the following symptoms (cough with or without sputumproduction, dyspnea, tachypnea, pleuritic chest pain) plus one auscultatory \ufb01nding or one sign of infection (core body temperature >38 \u00b0C, shivers, leukocyte count >10,000 cells\/\u03bcl or <4000 cells\/\u03bcl [1].

The sample extract was vigorously vortexed for 1 min, and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analysis.","Chromatography: UHPLC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS was performed as we described previously [1]. Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm, Milford Massachusetts, USA) was used for the chromatographic separation of plasma supernatant with injection volume of 5 \u03bcl. Temperatures of the column and autosampler were maintained at 45 \u00b0C and 10 \u00b0C, respectively. The separation was performed at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min under a gradient program in which mobile phase A was composed of 0.1% formic acid (v\/v) in water and mobile phase B was composed of acetonitrile. The gradient program was applied as follows: time (t) = 0 min, 5% B; t = 0.5 min, 5% B; t = 5.5 min, 48% B; t = 16 min, 78% B; t = 31min, 80% B; t = 33min, 99.5% B; t = 37min, 99.5% B; t = 37.1 min, 5% B.

Other source conditions were kept constant in all the experiments as follow: gas temperature was kept constant at 320 \u00b0C, drying gas (nitrogen) was set at the rate of 7 l\/min, and the pressure of nebulizer gas (nitrogen) was 30 psi. The sheath gas was kept at a flow rate of 10 l\/min at a temperature of 380 \u00b0C. The voltages of the fragmentor, skimmer 1, and octopoleRFPeak were 135V, 50V and 500V, respectively. The mass data was collected between m\/z 80 and 1,700 at the acquisition rate of 2 scans per second. Two reference masses at m\/z 121.0509 (protonated molecular ion of C5H4N4) and m\/z 922.0098 (protonated molecular ion of C18H18O6N3P3F24) for positive mode as well as m\/z 119.0363 (deprotonated molecular ion of C5H4N4) and m\/z 966.0007 (formate adduct of C18H18O6N3P3F24) for negative mode were used as constant mass correction during liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) run. Product ion scanning experiments were conducted using ultra-high purity nitrogen as collision gas with same parameters set in MS acquisition, the collision energy (CE) was set at 10, 20 or 40eV to generate the best quality of MS\/MS spectra for the putative identification and structural elucidation of the significant metabolites.","Data transformation: The metabolomic data was analyzed and reported according to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (http:\/\/msi-workgroups.sourceforge.net\/). The LC-MS data was processed using XCMS package (http:\/\/www.bioconductor.org\/packages\/2.8\/bioc\/html\/xcms.html) operating in R script (http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/). Data was further processed with normalization, scaling, filtering and statistical analysis using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 (www.metaboanalyst.ca). The MS data was log2-transformed, mean-centered, and divided by the standard deviation of each variable scaling for statistical analysis. To identify molecular features (MFs) that can distinguish CAP cases with non-CAP controls, both multivariate and univariate analyses were performed. For multivariate analyses, principal component analysis (PCA) and partial-least squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) were performed for unsupervised and supervised analyses, respectively. PLS-DA models were validated based on accuracy, multiple correlation coefficient (R2) and cross-validated R2 (Q2) in cross-validation and permutation test by applying 2,000 iterations, and the significance of the variables was ranked using the variable importance in projection (VIP) score. For univariate analysis, volcano plots were constructed and analyzed using Student\u2019s t-test. Significant MFs with VIP score of >1 in PLSDA and volcano plot analysis of fold-change >1.5 and P values <0.05 were included for univariate receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis using ROCEET (http:\/\/www.roccet.ca). The classical ROC curve analysis was performed. Area-under-receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated by Monte Carlo Cross Validation using sub-sampling. Significant MFs with AUC \u22650.8 were identified and box-whisker plots were generated using Analyse-it software (Analyse-it, UK). The data was subsequently processed with hierarchical clustering analysis employing Eluclidean distance measure with average clustering algorithm using MetaboAnalyst 3.0.","Metabolite id: Significant variables were selected for product ion scanning experiments. MS\/MS spectra were processed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.05.00, Agilent Technologies, USA) to generate potential molecular formula based on the accurate mass and isotopic pattern recognitions of parent and fragment ions. All putative identities were confirmed by matching with entries in the METLIN database (http:\/\/metlin.scripps.edu\/), Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) (http:\/\/www.hmdb.ca\/), MassBank (http:\/\/www.massbank.jp\/), LipidMaps (http:\/\/www.lipidmaps.org\/), KEGG database (http:\/\/www.genome.jp\/kegg) using exact molecular weights, nitrogen rule or MS\/MS fragmentation pattern data and literature search.

The complex metabolic relationships that exist between members of the intestinal microbiota, and potential redundancy in functional pathways, means an integrative analysis of changes in both structure and function are needed to understand the impact of antibiotic exposure. We used a combination of next generation sequencing and NMR metabolomics to characterise the effect of two clinically important antibiotic treatments, ciprofloxacin or vancomycin-imipenem, on the intestinal microbiome of female C57BL\/6 mice. This assessment was performed longitudinally and spanned both antibiotic challenge and subsequent microbiome re-establishment. Both antibiotics significantly altered microbiota and metabolite composition of faecal pellets during challenge and recovery. Spearman\u2019s correlation analysis of microbiota and NMR data revealed that, while some metabolites could be correlated with individual operational taxonomic units (OTU), frequently multiple OTUs were associated with a significant change in a given metabolite. Furthermore, one metabolite, arginine, can be associated with increases\/decreases in different sets of OTUs in differing conditions. Taken together, this indicates that reliance on shifts in one data set alone will generate an incomplete picture of the functional effect of antibiotic intervention. Full mechanistic understanding will require knowledge of the baseline microbiota composition combined with both a comparison and integration of microbiota, metabolomics and phenotypic data.\u2003","Sample collection: Faeces were collected from 4-week old female C57BL\/6 mice at Charles River UK Ltd (Margate, UK) under commercial licence, with all mice maintained and used in accordance with the Animal Scientific Procedures Act (1986) and amendment regulations 2012. All mice were initially housed in one barrier room within the facility and then transferred to an isolator on commencement of antibiotic treatment, where they were divided into three groups of eight mice each (4 mice per cage). The three groups represented a control group (no treatment), and two antibiotic treatment groups (either vancomycin-imipenem or ciprofloxacin). Six week old mice were placed on the same diet (a VRF1 diet, SDS) and antibiotics were dosed at 50 mg\/kg\/day delivered in drinking water. Fresh medicated solutions were prepared weekly and stored at 4 \u00b0C. Water was changed twice weekly and mice were observed closely for any changes in hydration or adverse effects; mice were weighed once a week throughout the study. No significant differences in mass were observed between groups during the study with mice in control, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin-imipenem groups attaining masses of 19.26 \u00b1 1.38 g, 19.45 \u00b1 1.11 and 19.03 \u00b1 0.81 g respectively. One faecal pellet was taken from each mouse at three time points: T1) Prior to commencement of antibiotic treatment, T2) At termination of treatment after fourteen days on antibiotics, T3) Nine days after antibiotic treatment ceased. After collection, pellets were placed into separate, sterile collection tubes and frozen at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis.","Extraction: Known mass of mouse faeces were immersed in 1 ml of cold (4 \u00b0C) 1 x sterile PBS (pH 7.4) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK) and centrifuged at 13,000 x g for 10 mins to form a pellet for DNA extraction. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh microfuge tube for metabolomics study. DNA extraction was performed using MoBio Powerlyzer Powersoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, USA), as previously described [1].

Supernatants were frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen, lyophilised at -58 \u00b0C overnight, and re-suspended in 500 \u00b5l D2O.","Nmr spec: 1H NMR spectra were acquired under automation at 298 K and 700 MHz on a Bruker Avance II 700 NMR spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Coventry, UK) equipped with a 5 mm QCI helium-cooled cryoprobe and a cooled SampleJet sample changer.","Nmr assay: The temperature was allowed to stabilise for 3 min after insertion into the magnet. Tuning, matching and shimming was performed for each sample and the 1H pulse length was calibrated on each sample and was typically around 12 \u00b5s. One Dimensional (1D) CPMG-presat (cpmgpr1d) experiments were acquired with 128 transients, a spectral width of 20.5 ppm, 64K data points, a mixing time of 10 ms, a relaxation delay of 4 s and a total echo delay of 78.7 ms. 1D NOESY-presat (noesygppr1d) were also acquired, but with 32 transients. Free induction decays were multiplied with an exponential function (line broadening of 0.3 Hz), fourier transformed and calibrated to a 2,2,3,3,-D4-3-(Trimethylsilyl) propionic acid (TSP) reference signal at 0.0 ppm.","Data transformation: Phase correction was performed manually and automatic baseline correction was applied. Regions above 8.5 ppm and below 0.5 ppm were excluded because of noise content. The water peak and TSP reference signal were also excluded. Spectra further aligned with the icoshift (68) algorithm and bucketed with the optimized bucketing algorithm (69) using 0.005 ppm minimum bin size leaving 1652 data points per spectrum. These spectra were PQN normalized and pareto-scaled [1]. To help in the assignment of metabolite resonances, 2D J-resolved (jresgpprqf) and COSY (cosygpprqf) spectra were acquired on a subset of samples. In 2D J-resolved spectra, 64 transients of 8K data points were acquired for each of 40 increments with a relaxation delay of 2 s, during which the solvent signal was suppressed by presaturation. Spectral widths of 16 ppm and 78 Hz were used. In 2D COSY spectra, 8 transients of 4K data points were acquired for each of 400 increments with a relaxation delay of 2 s, during which the solvent signal was suppressed by presaturation. A spectral width of 16 ppm was used in each dimension. Ref: [1] Vermeer LS, Fruhwirth GO, Pandya P, Ng T, Mason AJ.

Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) relative abundance was imported into the Primer-E software (v.6; Primer-E Ltd., Plymouth, United Kingdom) for beta diversity analysis. Bray-Curtis similarities were calculated based on the square root-transformed OTU relative abundances and were used in the nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination plot. The permutational analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) model was used for testing the null hypothesis of no difference between the compared groups (54), based on the parameters\u2019 permutation of residuals under a reduced model and a type III sum of squares. PERMDISP was used to assess the dispersion of the microbial community within the groups (54). Microbial differences between groups at the taxonomic level were tested for statistical significance based on the Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests using GraphPad Prism 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA). The LEfSe algorithm was performed using the Galaxy application tool (http:\/\/huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu\/galaxy\/) with a linear discriminant analysis cutoff score of 3.0 and a P of <0.05 for statistical significance (55). Functional predictions of microbial community were performed using PICRUSt on closed-reference OTUs with 97% identity based on the Greengenes database (v13.5) (56). The OTUs were normalized on PICRUSt and used for the prediction of KEGG orthologs (KOs). The predicted metagenome was statistically analyzed on STAMP using Welch\u2019s t test with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction for the false-discovery rate (FDR) and filtered to retain features with an effect size (ratio of proportions) of greater than two (77). A heatmap was generated using the ggplots2 package (v2.0.0), and a dendrogram of bacterial taxa was generated based on the Bray-Curtis distances and hierarchical clustering performed using Ward\u2019s method (78, 79). Two and three mice, respectively, were excluded from the microbiota and metabolome analysis, as samples from them failed quality control thresholds. For analysis of the metabolome data, cross-validation was performed. Seventy-five percent of the samples were used as a training set, and the remaining 25% were used as a test set, ensuring that the number of samples in the test set was proportional to the total number of samples from each class and that at least one sample from each class was present in the test set. To choose the number of components for the model, a leave-one-out cross-validation step was carried out on the samples in the training set, and the F1 was used to choose the number of components, with the additional constraint that a maximum of 8 components was used. A double cross-validation was repeated 2,000 times for each group with randomly chosen samples in the training and test sets to prevent bias due to the choice of training or test set. This procedure was repeated with randomly generated class assignments to provide a reference value for Q2. The chosen number of components minus one was then used as an OPLS filter, and a PLS-DA with two components was carried out on the filtered data to yield one predictive and one orthogonal component. In the back-scaled loadings analysis, peaks that allow the models to distinguish between classes were assigned by comparing chemical-shift values and multiplicities from J-resolved NMR spectra to values from the BMRB (80), HMDB (81), and Chenomx software. Volcano plots were generated in R. Five samples were excluded from the metabolome analysis, as these samples failed quality control thresholds. Microbiota and metabolome associations based on Spearman\u2019s correlation were performed in R using the corrplot package. Bacterial taxa and metabolites were sorted according to hierarchical clustering based on Euclidean distances, and Ward\u2019s method was used to perform cluster analysis."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS422","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS422","title":"Divergent relationships between faecal microbiota and metabolome following distinct antibiotic-induced disruptions","date":"2017-03-03","timestamp":1488499200,"submitter":["Tokuwa Kanno","A Mason","Jocelyn Choo","Nur Masirah Zain","Lex Leong","Guy Abell","Julie Keeble","Kinneth Bruce","Geraint Rogers"],"publications":[{"title":"Divergent relationships between faecal microbiota and metabolome following distinct antibiotic-induced disruptions","doi":"10.1128\/msphere.00005-17","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Bruker","organism":"Mus musculus","organism_parts":"feces","metabolites":["?","valerate","butyrate","pantothenate","isoleucine","leucine|isoleucine","leucine","valine","propionate","ethanol","hydroxybutyrate","lactate","acetoin","alanine","lysine|leucine","thymine","acetate","glutamate","n-acetylglucosamine","glutamate|glutamine","methionine","succinylacetone?","succinate","glutamine","saccharopine","riboflavin?

Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative. First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded. Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded [2][3].

variation can be extremely useful in unraveling the determinants of phenotypic trait evolution but has rarely been analyzed with unbiased metabolic profiling to understand how its effects are organized at the level of biochemical pathways. Native populations of Nicotiana attenuata, a wild tobacco species, have been shown to be highly genetically diverse for traits important for their interactions with insects. To resolve the chemodiversity existing in these populations, we developed a metabolomics and computational pipeline to annotate leaf metabolic responses to Manduca sexta herbivory. We selected seeds from 43 accessions of different populations from the southwestern United States\u2014including the well-characterized Utah 30th generation inbred accession\u2014and grew 183 plants in the glasshouse for standardized herbivory elicitation. Metabolic profiles were generated from elicited leaves of each plant using a high-throughput ultra HPLC (UHPLC)-quadrupole TOFMS (qTOFMS) method, processed to systematically infer covariation patterns among biochemically related metabolites, as well as unknown ones, and finally assembled to map natural variation. Navigating this map revealed metabolic branch-specific variations that surprisingly only partly overlapped with jasmonate accumulation polymorphisms and deviated from canonical jasmonate signaling. Fragmentation analysis via indiscriminant tandem mass spectrometry (idMS\/MS) was conducted with 10 accessions that spanned a large proportion of the variance found in the complete accession dataset, and compound spectra were computationally assembled into spectral similarity networks. The biological information captured by this networking approach facilitates the mining of the mass spectral data of unknowns with high natural variation, as demonstrated by the annotation of a strongly herbivory-inducible phenolic derivative, and can guide pathway analysis.","Sample collection: Seeds from N. attenuata Torrey ex Watson were collected over the last 20 years by Ian T. Baldwin and his collaborators in the Southwestern USA and germinated [1]. The well-characterized inbred line \u2018UT\u2019 which we used as a control comparison was collected from southwestern UT in 1996 [2] and has been self-fertilized for 30 generations in glasshouse conditions in Jena, Germany. Metabolic changes induced during Manduca sexta feeding were elicited in a highly synchronized fashion by producing with a fabric pattern wheel three rows of punctures onto each side of the midvein of five fully expanded leaves per plant at rosette stage and immediately applying 1:1 diluted M. sexta oral secretions (OS) to the puncture wounds. Four treated leaves were harvested, pooled, flash-frozen 72 h after elicitation and metabolites were extracted. Ref: [1] Krugel T, Lim M, Gase K, Halitschke R and Baldwin IT.

Typical instrument settings were as follows: capillary voltage 4500 V, capillary exit 130 V, dry gas temperature 200\u00b0C, dry gas flow of 8 l\/min. Ions were detected from m\/z 50 to 1400 at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50\/50% v\/v isopropanol\/water containing 0.2% formic acid). idMS\/MS datasets were acquired by operating the instrument with an isolation mass 400 Da, an isolation width 300 Da (largest width meaning all mass is accessible) and collision energies set either to 20, 30, 40, 50 ev to cover broad range mass signal fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). idMS\/MS data collection was restricted to ten samples that were initially selected based on the high range of chemical variations within the total sample population that these samples captured. 4 \u00b5l of each of these samples were first analyzed by UHPLC-ESI\/qTOF-MS in profile mode (single MS approach, collision energy of 0 ev) using the aforementioned chromatographic conditions with the objective of identifying compound precursors later on associated with molecular fragments as well as of inferring fragmentation patterns due to in-source collision during ionization (low cone voltage settings). The same samples were then analyzed for idMS\/MS data acquisition at 4 different collision energy conditions (20, 30, 40 and 50 ev) separately with all detectable mass signals being equally considered as dissociation targets.

Objectives: This study investigated whether treatment with a stable obestatin analogue (PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) changed plasma metabolite levels firstly in lean and subsequently in diet-induced obesity (DIO) C57BL6\/J mice. Method: Untargeted LC-HRMS metabolomics experiments were carried out in ESI+ mode with plasma extracts from both groups of animals. Data were normalised, multivariate and univariate statistical analysis performed and metabolites of interest putatively identified. Result: In lean mice, 39 metabolites were significantly changed by obestatin treatment and the majority of these were increased, including various C16 and C18 moieties of phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine and monoacylglycerol, along with vitamin A, vitamin D3, tyrosine, acetylcarnitine and 2alpha-(hydroxymethyl)-5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol. Decreased concentrations of glycolithocholic acid, 3-dehydroteasterone and various phospholipids were observed. In DIO mice, 25 metabolites were significantly affected and strikingly, the magnitudes of changes here were generally much greater in DIO mice than in lean mice, and in contrast, the majority of metabolite changes were decreases. Four metabolites affected in both groups included glycolithocholic acid, and three different long-chain (C18) phospholipid molecules (phosphatidylethanolamine, platelet activating factor (PAF), and monoacylglycerol). Metabolites exclusively affected in DIO mice included various phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and fatty acyls, as well as creatine and oxidised glutathione. Conclusion: This investigation demonstrates that obestatin treatment affects phospholipid turnover and influences lipid homeostasis, whilst providing convincing evidence that obestatin may be acting to ameliorate diet-induced impairments in lipid metabolism, and it may influence steroid, bile acid, PAF and glutathione metabolism.","Sample collection: C57BL6\/J male mice were bred in-house, maintained under constant climatic conditions at 21 \u00b0C with 12:12 h light\u2013dark cycles, housed either individually or in pairs and given free access to food and water. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act, 1986 and approved by the Queen\u2019s University Belfast Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body. Lean mice (n=12) received a standard laboratory diet, composed of 16.4% protein, 4.0% fat and 48.5% carbohydrate (3.0 kcal\/g; Teklad global rodent diet, Envigo, UK) for 23 weeks from birth. For the final 6 weeks animals were injected with either saline (n=6) or a modified obestatin peptide N-PEGylated(Cys10, Cys13)obestatin (n=6; PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)) (GL Biochem, China) at 50nmol\/kg\/day. Injections were administered subcutaneously in the back of the neck at a volume of 10 ml\/kg and the final weight range of the animals in each group was 25-33 g (saline) and 26-33 g (PEG-OB (Cys10, Cys13)). In a separate experiment the effects of PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) were investigated in DIO mice (n=11) which received a standard laboratory diet until 4 weeks of age, thereafter they received a high fat diet (20.5% protein, 36.0% fat and 35.7% carbohydrate (5.49 kcal\/g; Mouse Diet, 60% Fat Calories, BioServ, USA) for 19 weeks. For the final 6 weeks, mice were separated into two groups and injected with either saline (n=5) or PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) (n=6) at 50 nmol\/kg\/day as for lean mice. The final weight range of the DIO animals in each group was 39-55 g (saline) and 42-56 g (PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13). At the end of the 23 week period, mice were fasted for 5 h were and sacrificed by CO2 asphyxiation 3 h after the onset of the light cycle and exactly 1 h after injection on the final day of treatment. Blood obtained by cardiac puncture was collected into pre-chilled heparinised tubes, centrifuged at 3000 x g for 10 min (4 \u00b0C) and the resulting plasma transferred to W\/PTFE lined vials (Supelco, USA) prior to storage at -20 \u00b0C for metabolomic analysis.","Extraction: Frozen plasma aliquots were thawed on ice and 100 \u00b5l was added to 300 \u00b5l of ice cold methanol (100%) in a 2 ml sterile Eppendorf tube. Samples were mixed for 30 s and the protein removed by centrifugation at 13000 x g for 15 min (4 \u00b0C). Supernatants were evaporated to dryness, reconstituted in 100 \u00b5l of ultra-pure water (Millipore) and filtered by centrifugation using a 0.22 \u00b5m Costar spin-X centrifuge tube filter (8000 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 5 min; Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY 14831, USA).","Chromatography: All solvents were purchased from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburg, USA) and were LC-MS grade or equivalent. Chromatography was performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system (Dionex, Softron GmbH, Germany) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). 5 \u00b5l of extracted plasma was injected (n=3 injections for each sample) onto an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m, Waters, Wexford, Ireland) operating at 50 \u00b0C and applying a binary mobile phase system. The sample manager temperature was maintained at 4 \u00b0C and the order in which samples were injected was randomised throughout the experiment. The gradient elution buffers were A (water with 0.1% formic acid (vol\/vol)) and B (methanol with 0.1% formic acid (vol\/vol)). Solvent B was varied as follows: 0 min 1%, 2.5 min 1%, 16 min 99%, 18 min 99%, 18.1 min 1% and 20 min 1% with a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min.","Mass spec: Eluting compounds were detected using an LTQ Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) in positive ionisation mode with these conditions; source heater temperature at 400 \u00b0C, sheath gas at 60 (AU), aux gas at 45 (AU) and sweep gas at 1 (AU), capillary temp was maintained at 325 \u00b0C and source voltage at 3.5 kV. Mass spectra data were acquired in profile mode over the 50-1200 m\/z range with a mass resolution of 60,000 at mass 400 (FWHM) and a scan time of 0.5 s. In further experiments, the same samples were subjected to mass fragmentation analysis (FT HCD (10, 30 and 70 NCE), MS2) with an isolation width of 1 Da and 60,000 FWHM at 400 m\/z. Initially the mass spectrometer was calibrated using LTQ Velos ESI Positive Ion Calibration Solution (Thermo Scientific) and a mixture of metabolites (100 \u00b5g\/ml uridine, nicotinic acid, tryptophan, hippuric acid and phenylalanine; ACROS organics) in water. Prior to sample analysis 10 pooled conditioning samples were injected. To determine chromatographic reproducibility of retention times and peak intensities, pooled samples were injected after every 10 sample injections throughout the experiment [1]. Ref: [1] Graham, S.

PMID:23252551 ","Data transformation: UPLC-MS acquired data were analysed using Progenesis QI software (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA) for peak alignment, peak picking and data normalisation. A peak threshold filter of 2.5 AU was applied and peak picking thresholds were set between 0.5 and 20 minutes. Data were normalised to all compounds by correcting for multiple features to determine a global scaling factor. An output table was subsequently generated to include paired m\/z retention times and raw and normalised peak intensities for pools and individual samples. These metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis by principal component analysis (PCA) and data quality was assessed via visualisation of clustering of pools and sample replicates. PCA observations were indicative of good platform stability. UPLC-MS acquired data for all samples (lean and DIO) were subsequently reanalysed using Progenesis QI as previously described. On the basis of normalised peak intensities, metabolic features were reduced by exclusion of those observations showing no change in magnitude (fold change = 1) and no significant statistical difference (P>0.05, students t-test). Metabolic features were reduced from 3819 to 736 and 3819 to 615 when PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated mice were compared within lean and DIO groups respectively. This was carried out to avoid over-fitting and to improve the model\u2019s predictive ability. Using the average value for each biological replicate the filtered metabolic features were exported to Simca 14 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for multivariate analysis. Data were mean centred, pareto scaled and grouped into PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated groups for analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures via partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The ions with the greatest influence on separation between PEG-OB(Cys10, Cys13) and saline treated animals were highlighted by the S-plots.","Metabolite id: Discriminatory metabolites as highlighted in the S plot were investigated by using exact mass when searching HMDB [1][2][3] (http:\/\/www.hmdb.ca\/) and the Metlin library (https:\/\/metlin.scripps.edu\/) online databases.

Separation of lipids was achieved using an Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column (2.1\u00d7100 mm, 1.7 \u03bcm, Waters) with a gradient mobile phase comprising of 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile\/water (A, 60:40, v\/v) and 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.1% formic acid in isopropanol\/acetonitrile (B, 90:10, v\/v). The mobile phase was delivered at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min. The column was eluted initially with 40% B and immediately a linear gradient to 43% B over 2 min, then the percentage of B was increased to 50% within 0.1 min. Over the next 3.9 min, the gradient was further ramped to 54% B, and the amount of B was increased to 70% in 0.1 min. In the final part of the gradient, B was increased to 99% in 1.9 min.

Samples were random ordered, and 10 QCs were injected at the beginning to condition the column. To investigate the repeatability of the data, one QC was inserted and analyzed every ten samples.","Data transformation: UPLC-MS raw data were imported into the Progenesis QI 2.0 data analysis software (Nonlinear Dynamics, Newcastle, UK) for peak picking, alignment. Intensity of each peak was normalized with all compounds, and produce peak intensities for retention time and m\/z data pairs. Further data preprocessing was performed with the normalized peak intensities using in-house software metaX. To reduce redundant and produce comparable peaks, retention time (0.5-9.0 min) and peak width (1 s-30 s) tolerance were configured with Progenesis QI. To further improve the data quality, the number of zeros being <50% of QC samples or <80% of real samples were removed, the remaining zero values were replaced with kNN algorithm (k-Nearest Neighbor). Principal components analysis (PCA) for outlier detection was also performed with MetaX on the pre-processed dataset. To minimize the signal intensity drift over time, the QC-RLSC (Quality control-based robust LOESS signal correction), which is fitted to the QC data with respect to the order of injection, was conducted. In addition, relative standard deviations (RSD) for metabolic features were calculated across all QC samples.

Metabolome and transcriptome profiling and experiments with oxidative and drought stress in wild-type, single overexpressors of MYB12\/PFG1 (PRODUCTION OF FLAVONOL GLYCOSIDES1) or MYB75\/PAP1 (PRODUCTION OF ANTHOCYANIN PIGMENT1), double overexpressors of MYB12 and PAP1, transparent testa4 (tt4) as a flavonoid-deficient mutant, and flavonoid-deficient MYB12 or PAP1 overexpressing lines (obtained by crossing tt4 and the individual MYB overexpressor) demonstrated that flavonoid overaccumulation was key to enhanced tolerance to such stresses. Antioxidative activity assays using 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl, methyl viologen, and 3,3'-diaminobenzidine clearly showed that anthocyanin overaccumulation with strong in vitro antioxidative activity mitigated the accumulation of reactive oxygen species in vivo under oxidative and drought stress.

Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on \u201cultrafast\u201d experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism.","Sample collection: Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Moneymaker) were grown in a glass greenhouse in South-West of France in optimal commercial conditions as described previously [1]. The fruit were harvested at four different stages of development: 8, 21, 34 and 55 days post anthesis (DPA) on three different trusses (truss 5, 6, and 7). Eight DPA corresponds to the cell division stage, 21 DPA to the cell expansion stage, 34 DPA to the transition between cell expansion and ripening and 55 DPA to red-ripe fruit. Each biological replicate was made up of 4\u20135 fruits harvested on different plants. Three biological replicates, corresponding to the three different trusses, were used for each stage of the development. A quarter of the fruit pericarp from the equatorial zone was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fruit pericarp samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until freeze-drying. An aliquot of fresh frozen powder was lyophilized and used for NMR analyses.

PMID:24474652 ","Extraction: Each extract was prepared from 40 mg (2 aliquots of 20 mg each) of lyophilized powder using a robotised Starlet platform (Hamilton, Villebon sur Yvette, France). The metabolic extraction was performed in four steps. After weighing 20 mg, 300 \u00b5l of EtOH\/water (80\/20, v\/v) solution were added to each sample in a 1.1 ml Micronics tube, then the mixture was checked and put in a hot water bath at 80 \u00b0C during 10 min and finally placed in a centrifuge at 4,000 x g during 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a 1.4 ml Micronics tube. The 1.1 ml Micronics tube containing the pellet was submitted to three other extraction steps: same solvent mixture, then EtOH\/water (50\/50, v\/v), and pure Milli-Q water for the last step. The supernatants from the two aliquots and four steps were combined and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum evaporator (SpeedVac Savant, Asheville, USA). The dried extracts were titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h.","Sample collection: Just before the NMR acquisition, 600 \u00b5l of deuterium oxide (D2O; 99.90%D, Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France) containing sodium azide (NaN3, 3.85 mM final concentration, in order to avoid bacterial contamination) were added to the dried titrated extracts, and the solubilized titrated extract was transferred into a 5 mm NMR Wilmad LabGlass tube of 7 inches (Wilmad, Vineland, USA).","Nmr spec: All the NMR spectra of the tomato fruit extract samples were recorded three times at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III 500 spectrometer, operating at a frequency of 500.13 MHz with a dual 5 mm cryogenically cooled 1H-13C probe.","Nmr assay: For each experiment, the 90\u00b0 pulse width was carefully calibrated and the water signal at 4.7 ppm was presaturated by continuous irradiation during the recovery delay. All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 4.5 ppm in both dimensions at 500 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS\u2022N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 500 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 64 and N1 = 1, as interleaving was not needed to sample the relevant spectral width. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G\/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G\/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G\/cm and 256 \u00b5s. The amplitude and duration of the pre-acquisition gradient were adapted to center the chemical shift range of interest in the middle of the detection window in the spatially encoded dimension.

PMID:24322368 ","Data transformation: Before Fourier Transformation, 2D FIDs were weighed with apodization functions leading to the optimum sensitivity for the relevant peaks. A sinebell function was applied in the conventional dimension of all the experiments. In the ultrafast dimension, an apodization was performed in the spatial dimension with optimized gaussian apodization functions designed according to a recently described procedure [1]. The conventional spectra were zero-filled in both dimensions and the ultrafast spectra were zero-filled in the conventional dimension. All the spectra were processed in the magnitude mode. Finally, a second order automatic baseline correction was applied in the two dimensions of the 2D spectra.The specific processing for the ultrafast spectra (as described in [2]) was performed using a home-written routine in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany.

PMID:15369377 ","Metabolite id: Eight major polar compounds of tomato flesh, belonging to several metabolite families and implicated in fruit growth and quality, were selected for quantification. After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples. To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a\u2022[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample. To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite.

colorectal cancer, p53 is commonly inactivated, associated with chemo-resistance, and marks the transition from non-invasive to invasive disease. Cancers, including colorectal cancer, are thought to be diseases of aberrant stem cell populations, as stem cells are able to self-renew, making them long-lived enough to acquire mutations necessary to manifest the disease. We have shown that extracts from sweet sorghum stalk components eliminate colon cancer stem cells (CCSC) in a partial p53-dependent fashion. However, the underlying mechanisms are unknown. In the present study, CCSC were transfected with short hairpin-RNA against p53 (CCSC p53 shRNA) and treated with sweet sorghum phenolics extracted from different plant components (dermal layer, leaf, seed head and whole plant). While all components demonstrated anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects in CCSC, phenolics extracted from the dermal layer and seed head were more potent in eliminating CCSC by elevating caspases 3\/7 activity, PARP cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in a p53-dependent and p53-independent fashion, respectively. Further investigations revealed that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects were associated with decreases in beta-catenin protein levels, and beta-catenin targets cyclin D1, cMyc, and survivin. These results suggest that the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of sweet sorghum extracts against human colon cancer stem cells are via suppression of Wnt\/beta-catenin pro-survival signaling in a p53-dependent (dermal layer) and partial p53-independent (seed head) fashion. LCMS used to identify phenolic compounds associated with extract activity","Sample collection: Sweet sorghum materials from the Dale and M81E varieties used in this study were grown in Bakersfield, CA, and generously provided by Great Valley Energy LLC (Bakersfield, CA).","Extraction: Two extraction solvents were utilized for the study. Acetone (80%) was identified in the literature and empirically as a superior extraction solvent for sweet sorghum dermal and pith layers. Ethanol (80%) was used as a GRAS alternative. Fresh sweet sorghum sample (2 g) was extracted with 20 ml of extraction solvent chilled to \u221220 \u00b0C. This was to prevent excessive heating during the homogenization of the sample. This mixture was then homogenized for 2 min using an IKA T25 digital ultra TURRAX at 10 000 rpm. The tubes were then vortexed, and the resulting mixture was then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The supernatant was filtered using a 0.45 \u03bcm PTFE syringe filter (Tisch Scientific, North Bend, OH). The resulting pellet was then resuspended in 20 ml of extraction solvent by vortexing for 1 min and centrifuged, and the supernatant was collected and filtered. This was repeated for a third round of extraction, after which the filtrates were combined and the final volume was brought to 100 ml. The phenolic extracts were then stored at \u221220 \u00b0C until analysis for total phenolics and antioxidant activity and by LC\u2212MS.","Chromatography: One \u00b5l of sample held at 5 \u00b0C was injected into a Waters Acquity UPLC system fitted with a Waters Acquity UPLCT3 column (1.8 \u03bcm, 1.0 \u00d7 100 mm) with 100% solvent A (water, 0.1% formic acid) and this was held for 1 min. This was followed by a 12 min linear gradient to 95% solvent B (acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid). The flow rate was maintained at a constant 200 \u00b5l\/min and the column was maintained at a constant 50 \u00b0C for the entirety of the run.","Mass spec: Eluent from the UPLC system was infused into a Waters Xevo G2 Q-Tof MS instrument fitted with an electrospray source. Data were collected in the positive ion mode, scanning from 50-1200 at a rate of 0.2 s\/scan, alternating between MS and MSE mode. The collision energy was set to 6 V for MS mode and 15\u221230 V for MSE mode. The capillary voltage was set to 2200 V, the source temperature was 150 \u00b0C, the desolvation temperature was 350 \u00b0C, and the desolvation gas flow rate was 800 l\/h of nitrogen. Sodium formate was used to calibrate the equipment with mass accuracy within 1 ppm prior to the run. The UPLC\u2212MS system was quality checked by making five injections of a standard solution containing a 2 \u03bcg\/mL concentration each of caffeine, reserpine, sulfadimethoxine, and terfenadine in 50% methanol. The performance was evaluated using the final three injections, and acceptable performance is indicated by a retention time error of \u00b10.05 min, peak area RSD of <25%, and mass accuracy of <3 ppm error for all four compounds.","Data transformation: Waters raw data files were converted to .cdf format using Databridge software (Waters), and feature detection was performed using the open source XCMS software package. Raw peaks were normalized to total ion signal in R. Two raw data files were generated for the low collision energy (6V MS mode) and high energy indiscriminate collision energy (15-30V MSE mode). These files were zipped together. Files with extension 01 represent low energy and files with extension 02 represent high energy data for a given sample.","Metabolite id: Compounds were identified by comparing MS spectra obtained from LC\u2212MS analysis to the NIST, METLIN, and MassBank databases using 10 ppm as the upper limit for accuracy. In cases where spectra were not obtainable, accurate mass was used to identify the compounds."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS69","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS69","title":"Extracts from sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), a feedstock for biorefining, suppressed proliferation and elevated apoptosis in human colon cancer stem cells via suppression of Wnt\/beta-catenin signaling pathway","date":"2014-05-01","timestamp":1398898800,"submitter":["Jairam Vanamala","Lavanya Reddivari","Aaron Massey"],"publications":[{"title":"The Dermal Layer of Sweet Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) Stalk, a\nByproduct of Biofuel Production and Source of Unique\n3\u2011Deoxyanthocyanidins, Has More Antiproliferative and\nProapoptotic Activity than the Pith in p53 Variants of HCT116 and\nColon Cancer Stem Cells","doi":"10.1021\/jf405415u","pubmed":"PMID:24655033"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Xevo G2 QTOF (Waters)","organism":"Sorghum bicolor","organism_parts":"flower stalk","metabolites":["vanillic acid","p-coumaric acid","ferulic acid","caffeic acid","apigeninidin","luteolinidin","malvidin 3-O-glucoside","apigenin","luteolin","trans-resveratrol","luteoforol"]}},"MTBLS396":{"description":["The biological data served for fine-tuning of the developed decision rule sets.

activation of signal transduction pathways involved in defence. Currently, plant metabolomics is providing new dimensions into understanding the intracellular adaptive responses to external stimuli. The effect of LPS on the metabolomes of Arabidopsis thaliana cells and leaf tissue was investigated over a 24 h period. Cellular metabolites and those secreted into the medium were extracted with methanol and liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry was used for quantitative and qualitative analyses. Multivariate statistical data analyses were used to extract interpretable information from the generated multidimensional LC-MS data. The results show that LPS perception triggered differential changes in the metabolomes of cells and leaves, leading to variation in the biosynthesis of specialised secondary metabolites. Time-dependent changes in metabolite profiles were observed and biomarkers associated with the LPS-induced response were tentatively identified. These include the phytohormones salicylic acid and jasmonic acid, and also the associated methyl esters and sugar conjugates. The induced defensive state resulted in increases in indole-and other glucosinolates, indole derivatives, camalexin as well as cinnamic acid derivatives and other phenylpropanoids. These annotated metabolites indicate dynamic reprogramming of metabolic pathways that are functionally related towards creating an enhanced defensive capacity. The results reveal new insights into the mode of action of LPS as an activator of plant innate immunity, broadens knowledge about the defence metabolite pathways involved in Arabidopsis responses to LPS, and identifies specialised metabolites of functional importance that can be employed to enhance immunity against pathogen infection.","Sample collection: A. thaliana (ecotype Columbia, Col-0) callus cultures were initiated and grown as previously described[1]. Cells were subcultured onto fresh Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar medium[2] containing 3% sucrose (w\/v), 0.8% agar (w\/v), 2 mg\/ml 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, 100 mg\/ml myoinositol and B5 vitamins, every 14 days. Plants were grown in germination mix soil (Culterra, Muldersdrif, South Africa) at 23 \u00b0C, 50% humidity, and 60 \u00b5mol\/m^2\/sec fluorescent illumination in a 12 h light\/12 h dark cycle. 6 week old plants were used for experiments. Cells (50 g) were transferred to MS basal salts medium containing LPS (80 \u00b5g\/ml) in an 1:1.5 m\/v ratio, transferred to Falcon tubes and gently mixed to form a suspension. The cell suspensions were divided into 4 equal aliquots for different time points and kept at 25 \u00b0C under constant agitation to ensure aerobic conditions. A treatment time study of 8, 12 and 24 h was conducted, and 24 h non-treated cells were used as a negative control. Cell viability\u2013and cell permeability assays were conducted using the triphenyltetrazolium reduction and Evan\u2019s Blue dye uptake methods respectively[3], and did not reveal any detrimental effects of the LPS treatment. For Arabidopsis leaf elicitation, LPS was dissolved in sterile 10 mM MgSO4 to give a final concentration of 80 \u00b5g\/ml. Arabidopsis plants were treated with the LPS solution by pressure infiltration into the leaves using a blunt-ended syringe. A MgSO4-control and non-treated (NT) control were included in the experiments. Following elicitation, 4 leaves were cut from 3 different plants (constituting 1 biological replicate) for the extraction procedure. Subsequent to optimisation of conditions, each facet of the experimental design was repeated at least 3 times. Extracts generated from the various experimental treatments were analysed in triplicate (n = 9). Ref: [1] Huang J-C, Piater LA, Dubery IA.

For rapid quenching of enzyme activity, especially that of myrosinase, hot methanol (55 \u00b0C) was used to prevent degradation of GSs[2]. Extractions were carried out at 8, 12 and 24 h post-treatment respectively. Cell suspensions (20 ml) were centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 15 min, and the supernatants carefully removed and transferred to new 50 ml Falcon tubes. These supernatants, representative of the \u2018culture medium\u2019 and containing secreted metabolites, were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilised before extraction with methanol. The pellets remaining after centrifugation of the cell suspensions (10 g) were re-suspended in HPLC-grade methanol (1:1.5 m\/v), homogenised for 2 min using an Ultraturrax homogenizer (IKA, Staufen, Germany), and centrifuged at 15 000 x g for 15 min. The resulting supernatants were collected in new 50 ml Falcon tubes and represented the \u2018cell\u2019 fraction. The above extraction protocol was repeated twice and supernatants combined. Extracts were evaporated to 1 ml at 52 \u00b0C using rotary evaporation under vacuum and the remaining water removed by lyophilization. For both cell- and medium samples, the residues were re-suspended in 2 ml 50% HPLC-grade methanol. The mixtures were vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 6000 x g for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C. The supernatants were removed using a syringe and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m nylon syringe filters into glass vials for analyses. Leaves were cut and 3\u20135 g transferred to sterile 50 ml Falcon tubes, covered with 80% methanol (1:1 m\/v) and homogenised for 3 min. The homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 15 000 x g and supernatants collected into new Falcon tubes. Methanol was evaporated to 1 ml at 52 \u00b0C using a rotary evaporator. The residues were then re-suspended in 2 ml 50% HPLC grade methanol and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m syringe filters into glass vials. Ref: [1] Tugizimana F, Steenkamp PA, Piater LA, Dubery IA.

PMID:11705329 ","Chromatography: UHPLC-qTOF-MS analyses were performed on a Waters Acquity UHPLC (class \u2018Classic\u2019) coupled in tandem to a Waters photodiode array (PDA) detector and a SYNAPT G1 qTOF-mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation of the metabolites was carried out using a Waters HSS T3 column (150 x 2.1 mm), able to separate both polar and non-polar analytes. A binary solvent mixture of water containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min was used with an injection volume of 5 \u00b5l. A gradient protocol with a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min was used. The gradient was set as follows: 5% B over 0.0\u20131.0 min, 5\u201390% B over 1.0\u201310 min, held constant at 90% B over 10.00\u201312.00 min, and decreasing from 90% to 5% B over 13.00\u201315.00 min to return to the initial conditions. The PDA detector was set to scan between 200 and 500 nm (1.2 nm resolution) collecting 20 spectra\/s. A quality control sample consisting of pooled extracts was used to monitor system stability and Rt reproducibility (technical precision), and was injected every 10 runs.","Mass spec: The SYNAPT G1 qTOF-mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative modes to detect all metabolites of interest. Leucine enkephalin (50 pg\/ml) was used as the reference calibrant to obtain typical mass accuracies of between 1 and 3 mDa. A capillary voltage of 2.0 kV with a sampling- and extraction cone voltage of 30.0 V and 4.0 V was used respectively. The scan time was 0.1 s covering a mass range of 100 to 1000 Da. The source temperature was 120 \u00b0C and the desolvation temperature was set at 400 \u00b0C. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulisation gas at a flow rate of 800 l\/h. Each sample was analysed in triplicate in a randomised manner. The MS data was acquired in (MSE) mode (a function of the collision cell that alternates between low and high energy states to generate sequential unfragmented and in-source generated fragments) to assist with the annotation and identification of the biomarkers. Here, the MS experiment file was setup to perform unfragmented as well as five fragmenting experiments simultaneously. Ion fragmentation was performed by in-source collision energy ramping (3 eV\u201430 eV). Tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) analyses were carried out on selected identified biomarkers in order to provide structural information about the compounds of interest, thereby providing an increased level of confidence in the metabolite annotations.","Data transformation: ESI positive and negative raw data were extracted using MassLynx XSTM software and analysed with the MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). The parameters were set to analyse the 1\u201313 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatograms, mass range 100\u20131000 Da, mass tolerance 0.01 Da, mass window 0.05 Da and a Rt window of 0.20 min. Following MarkerLynxTM processing, the data matrix was exported into SIMCA-P (Soft independent modelling of class analogy) software, version 12 (Umetrics Corporation, Umea, Sweden), and Pareto scaled for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) modelling.","Metabolite id: Following separation and detection on the UHPLC-qTOF-MS SYNAPT G1, MassLynxTM software was used for analysis of the raw mass spectral data to compute molecular formulae for peaks of interest. The OPLS-DA S-plots were used for prioritising to-be-annotated metabolites that contributed to clustering of samples seen in the PCA plots. The S-plot gives a visual representation of the covariance and correlation from the OPLS-DA scatter plot. From these S-plots, lists of statistically significant and reliable signatory biomarkers were obtained, and putatively annotated according to the Metabolomic Standards Initiative (MSI), level 2[1]. The molecular formulae of the pseudo-molecular ions ([M-H]- or ([M+H]+) representing possible biomarkers were computed and selected based on the criterion that the mass difference between the measured and calculated mass was at\/or below 5 mDa. In addition, a number of parameters, including isotopic fit (iFit) and double bond equivalent (DBE) values, were taken into account in order to increase the level of confidence in the molecular formulae obtained. The elemental composition was then searched against online libraries\/databases: Dictionary of Natural Products (DNP) (dnp.chemnetbase.com), PubChem (www.pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), Chemspider (www.chemspider.com), AraCyc (www.arabidopsis.org\/tools\/aracyc), PlantCyc (www.plantcyc.org), MetaCyc (www.metaCyc.org), KEGG (www.genome.jp\/kegg), Metabolomics workbench (http:\/\/www.metabolomicsworkbench.org) and METLIN (metlin.scripps.edu). Moreover, annotation was based on interpretation of mass fragmentation patterns, MS\/MS spectra, mass spectral library searches as well as published literature and datasets[2]. MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) was employed to process and analyse the MS\/MS raw data for metabolite identification and structural characterisation. The MarkerLynxTM \u2018MassFragment\u2019 tool was used to allocate structures to the fragment ions observed in the LC\/MS\/MS tandem mass spectra by applying an in silico fragmentation algorithm to known precursor structures[3]. The structures of the various fragment ions were then compared to the fragmentation patterns observed in the MS\/MS spectra and a putative identification was made. Another tool employed in the study for metabolite annotation\/putative identification was the PUTMEDID_LC-MS workflow[4][5] that operates on the Taverna workbench (http:\/\/www.taverna.org.uk). Putative identification was based on accurate mass data. The data matrix files obtained on the MarkerLynx XSTM software were converted to a version compatible for the PUTMEDID_LC-MS workflow. In workflow 1, a list of pairwise peak correlations were compiled for input into workflow 2. Different ion types of the same metabolite which share similar features (such as Rt and mass differences) were grouped together using basic correlation coefficients such as Pearson or Spearman algorithms (workflow 2). Each accurate m\/z was then matched to an accurate mass of a neutral compound (reference file) and an elemental composition was calculated (workflow 2)[5]. Lastly, the molecular formulae were searched against accessible online databases\/libraries (mentioned above) for identification of metabolites, and a putative identification was made (www.mcisb.org\/resources\/putmedid.html).

The algorithm is based on a sensitive detection of mass traces, which are then assembled into features based on mass-to-charge spacing, co-elution information, and a support vector machine\u2013based classifier able to identify potential metabolite isotope patterns. The algorithm is not limited to metabolites but is applicable to a wide range of small molecules (e.g. lipidomics, peptidomics), as well as to other separation technologies. <\/p> We assessed the algorithm's robustness with regard to varying noise levels on synthetic data and then validated the approach on experimental data investigating human plasma samples. We obtained excellent results in a fully automated data-processing pipeline with respect to both accuracy and reproducibility. Relative to state-of-the art algorithms, ours demonstrated increased precision and recall of the method. The algorithm is available as part of the open-source software package OpenMS and runs on all major operating systems. <\/p> See MTBLS234 for the human plasma samples part of this study.","Sample collection: The dataset was based on a list of identified plant metabolites from a rather comprehensive study by Giavalisco et al. [1]. The authors reported the elemental composition, intensity, and retention time of hundreds of metabolites in the supplementary information for their study. This information is all that was needed in order to create synthetic datasets with characteristics typical of a complex metabolomics study.

PMID:21699588 ","Extraction: N\/A","Chromatography: For the generation of synthetic LC-MS datasets, we employed the software package MSSimulator [1]. The simulator creates profile data based on the experimentally determined retention time and the composition of a set of compounds. It can simulate different instrument resolutions, noise levels, and chromatographic performances. The datasets created here were based on experimentally identified metabolites and thus captured the complexity of a real-world sample. At the same time, the simulator provides complete control over signal-to-noise ratio, accuracy, and similar parameters that would be very difficult to vary independently of each other experimentally.

The machine-dependent settings of MSSimulator were chosen to be close to those of our experimental MS setup: The simulated MS resolution R was set to 20,000, and the scan time was set at 0.25 s. The output of MSSimulator consists of a centroided LC-MS measurement and a feature map summarizing all simulated metabolites with theoretical retention times, m\/z ratios, and intensities. This feature map facilitates comparison between the ground truth (the simulator's input) and the features detected by our algorithm applied to the same simulated data.","Data transformation: N\/A","Metabolite id: To assess the influence of different sources of noise on the feature-finding performance, we conducted three series of MS simulations, each affected by detector noise, m\/z variation, or elution profile distortion. In the first series, we simulated increasing levels of detector noise that were controlled by the Gaussian standard deviation sdet. The second series comprised two datasets simulated with moderate and strong mass errors (Gaussian standard deviation sm\/z set to 10 ppm and 40 ppm, respectively). For the third series, we simulated elution profiles with ideal peak shapes and heavily distorted shapes. In MSSimulator, the degree of distortion is controlled by the number of iterations ndist; that is, the greater the number of iterations performed, the more the elution profiles deviate from their smooth Gaussian shape.

Human pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hPSC-CMs) hold immense clinical potential and recent studies have enabled generation of virtually pure hPSC-CMs with high efficiency in chemically defined and xeno-free conditions. Despite these advances, hPSC-CMs exhibit an immature phenotype and are arrhythmogenic in vivo, necessitating development of methods to mature these cells. hPSC-CMs undergo significant metabolic alterations during differentiation and maturation. A detailed analysis of the metabolic changes accompanying maturation of hPSC-CMs may prove useful in identifying new strategies to expedite the maturation process and also provide biomarkers for testing or validating hPSC-CM maturation. In this study we identified global metabolic changes which take place during long-term culture and maturation of hPSC-CMs derived from three different hPSC lines. We have identified several metabolic pathways, including phospholipid metabolism and pantothenate and Coenzyme A metabolism, which showed significant enrichment upon maturation in addition to fatty acid oxidation and metabolism. We also identified an increase in glycerophosphocholine and reduction in phosphocholine as potential metabolic biomarkers of maturation. These biomarkers were also affected in a similar manner during murine heart development in vivo. These results support that hPSC-CM maturation is associated with extensive metabolic rewiring and understanding the role of these metabolic changes in maturation process has the potential to develop novel approaches to monitor and expedite hPSC-CM maturation.","Sample collection: The cells in 1 well from 12 well plate (~1-2 million) were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then the cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol.

used widely for its healing capabilities against cancer, with numerous anecdotal reports. In this study we investigated its in vitro cytotoxicity on human squamous cell carcinoma cells followed by metabolomic profiling of Carica papaya leaf decoction and leaf juice\/brewed leaf juice to determine the effects imparted by the long heating process typical of the Aboriginal remedy preparation. MTT assay results showed that in comparison with the decoction, the leaf juice not only exhibited a stronger cytotoxic effect on SCC25 cancer cells, but also produced a significant cancer-selective effect as shown by tests on non-cancerous human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. Furthermore, evidence from testing brewed leaf juice on these two cell lines suggested that the brewing process markedly reduced the selective effect of Carica papaya leaf on SCC25 cancer cells. To tentatively identify the compounds that contribute to the distinct selective anticancer activity of leaf juice, an untargeted metabolomic approach employing Ultra High Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time of Flight- Mass Spectrometry followed by multivariate data analysis was applied. Some 90 and 104 peaks in positive and negative mode respectively were selected as discriminatory features from the chemical profile of leaf juice and >1500 putative compound IDs were obtained via database searching. Direct comparison of chromatographic and tandem mass spectral data to available reference compounds confirmed one feature as a match with its proposed authentic standard, namely pheophorbide A. However, despite pheophorbide A exhibiting cytotoxic activity on SCC25 cancer cells, it did not prove to be the compound contributing principally to the selective activity of leaf juice. With promising results suggesting stronger and more selective anticancer effects when compared to the Aboriginal remedy, Carica papaya leaf juice warrants further study to explore its activity on other cancer cell lines, as well as investigation to confirm the identity of compounds contributing to its selective effect, particularly those compounds altered by the long heating process applied during the traditional Aboriginal remedy preparation.","Sample collection: Fresh Carica papaya leaves were collected from Tropical Fruit World (TFW), a privately-owned plantation orchard farm and research park in northern New South Wales, Australia (http:\/\/www.tropicalfruitworld.com.au\/). The papaya plants in this facility had not been sprayed with any chemicals. The leaves were thoroughly washed under running tap water to remove any particulate matter and rinsed carefully with MilliQ water to obtain clean leaves. Leaf decoction: Leaf decoction was prepared following the Australian remedy for cancer treatment; this recipe was also used in recent investigations[1][2]. The cleaned leaves (200 g) were partly dried in air at room temperature and then added to 2.5 l of deionized water in a glass beaker, brought to the boil and further heated uncovered for 4 hr. The leaf decoction was then lyophilised at -60 \u00b0C and 0.1 mbar using a Christ Alpha 2-4LD freeze-dryer (Martin Christ Gefriertrocknungsanlagen GmbH, Germany) to obtain a brown leaf decoction powder, which was portioned for storage at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Leaf juice: The method to obtain leaf juice was adapted from procedures used in studies for dengue fever[3][4] or toxicity of Carica papaya leaves[5]\u2013[7] as follows: The cleaned leaves were crushed using a mortar and pestle, without the addition of water. The juice was manually separated from the crushed leaf debris using clean muslin fabric, then lyophilised under the same conditions as the leaf decoction to obtain a dark green powder, which was portioned for storage at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis. Brewed leaf juice: To comprehensively evaluate the effect of the heating process, we included in our study an extract obtained by brewing the leaf juice powder under the same condition as processing the whole leaf to obtain the leaf decoction. Leaf juice powder was added to deionised water in a glass beaker with a ratio 200 mg in 100 ml of water and heated to the boil then further heated uncovered for 4 hr to create brewed leaf juice. The brewed leaf juice was then lyophilised under the same conditions as the leaf decoction to obtain a brown brewed leaf juice powder, which was portioned for storage at -80 \u00b0C prior to analysis.

PMID:25530788 ","Extraction: Leaf juice powder, brewed leaf juice powder, and leaf decoction powder were dissolved at concentrations of 2 mg\/ml in water then the obtained solutions subsequently filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m PVDF filter (Merck Millipore, Germany). When filtering, an adequate volume was passed through membrane filter; the first 1.0 ml was discarded and the remaining volume was collected in an HPLC vial, ready for injection. To facilitate direct comparison among the extracts, the concentrations of extracts used in mass spectrometric\/chemometric analysis were equivalently converted and expressed as concentrations of original leaf.","Chromatography: Chromatographic analysis of compounds in papaya leaf extracts was performed on an Agilent 1290 UHPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA). Chromatographic separation was achieved using a 2.1 x 150 mm, 3.5 \u00b5m ECLIPSE PLUS C18 analytical column (Agilent) with guard protection. Mobile phase A was MilliQ water containing 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 0.1% formic acid, adjusted to pH 7.0 \u00b1 0.1 and mobile phase B was 95% acetonitrile and 5% MilliQ water (v\/v) containing 5 mM ammonium bicarbonate and 0.1% formic acid. The following gradient elution was adopted: 10 to 80% B from 0 to 42 min; 80 to 90% B from 42 to 45 min; 90 to 100% B from 45 to 46 min; held at 100% B from 46 to 48 min; returned to 10% B over the next 2 min; column re-equilibration with 10% B for 10 min prior to the next injection. Thus the total chromatographic run time was 60 min. A flow rate of 0.2 ml\/min was applied and 20 \u00b5l of sample was injected.","Mass spec: Each extract was run in triplicate in both positive and negative ionisation mode. Mass spectrometric detection was performed on an Agilent 6520 high resolution accurate mass quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-ToF) mass spectrometer equipped with a multimode source operating in both Electrospray Ionisation (ESI) and Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation (APCI) modes. Mass spectral acquisition was controlled using MassHunter software (B.02.01 SP3\u2014Agilent). The mass spectrometer was operated using a mass range of m\/z 100\u20131700, at a scan rate of 3.0 cycles\/second using the following acquisition parameters: capillary voltage 2500 V, nebulizer pressure 30 psi, drying gas flow 5.0 l\/min, gas temperature 300 \u00b0C, fragmenting voltage 175 V, skimmer voltage 65 V. To ensure the desired mass accuracy of recorded ions, continuous internal calibration was performed during analysis with the use of reference ions m\/z 121.050873 (protonated purine) and m\/z 922.009798 (protonated hexakis) in positive mode; in negative mode, ions with m\/z 119.0362 (deprotonated purine) and m\/z 966.000725 (formate adduct of hexakis) were used to correct for scan to scan variations.","Data transformation: Data processing and analysis were performed using Agilent MassHunter Qualitative software (Version B.05.00) with Molecular Feature Extractor (MFE) algorithms in concert with Mass Profiler Professional software (Version 12.1, Agilent) to align features from the chromatograms of all 9 samples from 3 extracts of papaya leaves. The following cut-off settings were employed: minimum peak filters of 500 counts, peak spacing tolerance of 0.0025 m\/z plus 7.0 ppm, assigned charge states limited to a maximum of 2, minimum compound filters of 3000 counts.","Metabolite id: The data matrix obtained from MS data analysis was imported into SIMCA-P software (Version 13.0.3.0, MKS Umetrics AB, Sweden). Data were log10 transformed and mean centered prior to multivariate data analysis using principal component analysis (PCA\u2014unsupervised analysis) and Orthogonal Projection to Latent Structures-Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA\u2014supervised analysis). The scores and loadings plot from these analyses, which describe the multivariate relationships of the observations (samples) and the variables (LC-MS features) respectively, were then used to determine the features that contribute to the differences among the extracts. Preliminary compound identification of the features of interest was performed using a Personal Compound Database Library (PCDL) (Agilent, USA) with the METLIN Personal Metabolite Database and a customized database, compiled using the PCDL platform populated with compounds obtained from Naturally occurring Plant-based Anticancerous Compound-Activity-Target Database (NPACT)[1].

development and the validation of innovative approaches for biomarker selection are of paramount importance in many -omics technologies. Unfortunately, the actual testing of new methods on real data is difficult, because in real data sets, one can never be sure about the \u201ctrue\u201d biomarkers. In this paper, we present a publicly available metabolomic ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry spike-in data set for apples. The data set consists of 10 control samples and three spiked sets of the same size (G1,G2,G3), where naturally occurring compounds are added in different concentrations. In this sense, the data set can serve as a test bed to assess the performance of new algorithms (eg. biomarker selection, peak picking, etc.) and compare them with previously published results. The dataset includes the raw CDF files for all the injections. The raw data are organized in four assays: positive ion mode, negative ion mode, injections of the standard mixes (in both positive and negative ion modes). The spiked compounds are: epicatechin (CHEBI 90), catechin (CHEBI 15600), cyanidin-3-galactoside (CHEBI 27475), quercetin-3-galactoside (CHEBI 67486), quercetin-3-glucoside (CHEBI 28299), quercetin-3-rhamnoside (CHEBI 17558), resveratrol (CHEBI 27881), phloridzin (CHEBI 8113), quercetin (CHEBI 16243). All the compounds except resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside are known to be present in the apple extracts. Spiking concentrations have been defined taking as a reference the ones measured in a pooled apple extract. A detailed description of the spiking concentration in the three group is included in the spiking.pdf file.","Sample collection: Twenty apples, variety Golden Delicious, have been purchased locally. Extracts of every single fruit were prepared as shown previously [1]. The core of the fruit was removed with a corer, and each apple was cut into equal slices. Three slices (cortex and skin) from the opposite side of each fruit were used for the preparation of aqueous acetone extracts. Ref: [1] Vrhovsek U, Rigo A, Tonon D, Mattivi F. Quantitation of polyphenols in different apple varieties. J Agric Food Chem. 2004 Oct 20;52(21):6532-8. PMID:15479019 ","Extraction: The samples were homogenized in a blender Osterizer mod. 847-86 (Oster GmbH, Germany) at speed one in a mixture of acetone\/water (70\/30 w\/w). Extracts of 10 apples were used as controls, and the extracts of the other 10 apples were used to create the spiked samples. The latter were divided into three aliquots and spiked with different concentrations of known compounds. The full data set, then, consists of four groups of 10 samples each. The concentrations and nature of the spiking compounds were chosen in order to simulate the conditions of a typical two-class metabolomic experiment. Some of these biomarkers are known to be naturally present in Golden Delicious apples, and for these, an artificial increase of concentration simulates their relative accumulation in tissues. Two compounds not naturally present in the matrix were also added (trans-resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside), with the objective of simulating the biological synthesis of a new compound. The concentration of the biomarkers was chosen by taking as a reference the concentrations of the biomarker compounds measured in a pooled apple extract. The spiking concentration was constant in each group, but the use of different extracts conserves the absolute natural variation in marker levels between apples. As a consequence, any variation in concentration comes from analytical or biological variability. In each of the three groups, the spiking compounds are added in different concentrations, corresponding to approximate target increases of 20%, 40%, and 100%; in this way, for example, group 1 has 100% increase of quercetin-3-rhamnoside and phloridzin. The concentrations of trans-resveratrol and cyanidin-3-galactoside were chosen in such a way that the peak intensities should be in line with those of the other spike-in compounds.","Chromatography: Before the injection, acetone was evaporated by rotary evaporation, the samples were brought back to the original volume with ethanol and were filtered with a 0.22 \u00b5m filter (Millipore, Bedford, USA). Ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry spectra were acquired on an ACQUITY\u2013SYNAPT Q-TOF (Waters, Milford, USA) in positive and negative ion mode with the following chromatographic conditions: Column: BEH C18 1.7 um, 2.1 x 50mm; Column temperature 40 \u00b0C; Injection volume 5 \u00b5l; Eluent flux 0.8 ml\/min; Solvent A 0.1% formic acid in H2O; Solvent B 0.1% formic acid in MeOH; Gradient: Linear gradient from 0% to 100% of solvent B in 10 min, 100% of B for 2 min, 100% A within 0.1min, Equilibration for 2.9 min. No technical replicates were performed.","Mass spec: Ultra performance liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry spectra were acquired on an ACQUITY\u2013SYNAPT Q-TOF (Waters, Milford, USA) in positive and negative ion mode with the following mass spectrometry conditions: Mass spectrometer: SYNAPT Q-TOF (Waters); Mass range 50\u20133000 Da; Capillary 3 kV; Sampling cone 25 V; Extraction cone 3 V; Source temperature 150 \u00b0C; Desolvation temperature 500 \u00b0C; Cone gas flow 50 l\/h; Desolvation gas flow 1000 l\/h.","Data transformation: Raw data were transformed to the open NetCDF format by the DataBridge built-in utility of the MassLynx software (Waters Corp., Milford, MA).","Metabolite id: The CDF files were imported into R [1], which was used for the data analysis, with the XCMS package [2]. Feature detection was performed on the full data set using the matched-filter algorithm [2] with the following parameters: fwhm=20, max=50, snthresh=4, step=0.05. After peak picking, only features present in at least one-half of the 10 samples of one of the four groups were retained, thus keeping the default value for the \u201cgroup\u201d function in XCMS. A linear retention time correction was performed, followed by the re-analysis of the profile data at the positions of missing peaks (peak filling). No further processing of the peak intensities (e.g., normalization) was performed. Feature list annotation was performed by the R package CAMERA [3] with default parameters. The resulting annotated peak lists contain columns giving retention time and m\/z value of each feature, one column for the isotope annotation, one for the common adducts, and one for the group number. The latter is obtained by clustering the features considering their retention time and the correlation between the extracted ion chromatograms to identify co-eluting ions. As a result of this procedure, the features are grouped into groups (\u201cpcgroups\u201d), which are likely to be related to the same metabolite. To construct a data base containing the features corresponding to the spiked compounds, two standard mixtures were subject to the same analytical pipeline. The first mixture contained catechin, epicatechin, cyanidin-3-galactoside, quercetin-3-glucoside, and quercetin-3-rhamnoside; the second contained catechin, quercetin, trans-resveratrol, phloridzin, and quercetin-3-galactoside. In keeping to what was performed on the apple extract, peak picking on each chromatogram was performed by XCMS, with the same parameters used for the samples. Ref: [1] Team R D C.

It may also help in the analysis of disease-induced metabolomic changes in human tissues when the postoperational samples are compared to the post-mortem samples from healthy donors. Objectives: The goals of this study are to observe and classify the post-mortem changes occurring in the rabbit blood, aqueous and vitreous humors (AH and VH), to identify the potential PMI markers among a wide range of metabolites, and also to determine which biological fluid \u2013 blood, AH or VH \u2013 is more suitable for the PMI estimation. Methods: The quantitative metabolomic profiling of samples of the rabbit serum, AH and VH taken at different PMIs has been performed with the combined use of high-frequency NMR and high-resolution LC-MS methods. Results: The quantitative levels of 63 metabolites in the rabbit serum, AH and VH at different PMIs have been measured. It has been found that the post-mortem metabolomic changes in AH and VH proceed slower than in blood, and the data scattering is lower. Among the metabolites whose concentrations increase with time, the most significant and linear growth is found for hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol. Conclusion: The obtained results indicate the advantage of ocular fluids, AH and VH, over blood serum for the search of potential biochemical markers for the PMI estimation. Among the compounds studied in the present work, hypoxanthine, choline and glycerol give the biggest promise as the potential PMI biomarkers.","Sample collection: Experiments were carried out with 4 domestic rabbits of the same age (approximately 3-month-old) obtained from the vivarium of the Institute of Cytology and Genetics SB RAS. The animals were treated according to the ARVO Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and the European Union Directive 2010\/63\/EU on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes, with the ethics clearance from the International Tomography Center SB RAS. Animals were sacrificed by electrical stunning. The bodies of 3 rabbits were kept at room temperature (24-25 \u00b0C) for 31 hr. The ante-mortem blood samples were obtained right before the rabbit culling by venepuncture from the marginal ear vein. The post-mortem samples of aqueous humor (AH), vitreous humor (VH) and blood were collected immediately after death (5-10 min post-mortem) and 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, and 23 hr thereafter. 1 more blood sample from each animal was taken 31 hr post-mortem. The post-mortem blood samples (volume 0.4-1.0 ml) were taken by the direct cardiopuncture using the syringe with the thick needle (22G); the samples of AH (0.05-0.12 ml) were taken from the anterior chamber by the cornea puncture with the thin needle (27G), and the samples of VH (0.09-0.12 ml) \u2013 by the sclera puncture (in the ora serrata area) with the thick needle (18G). The first 4 samples of AH and VH (10 min, 1, 2, and 4 hr) were taken from 1 eye of each animal, and the second 4 samples \u2013 from the other. The collected blood samples were immediately centrifuged (3,000 x g, 10 min), and the plasma obtained was transferred into separate vials. The fluid samples (plasma, AH, VH) were immediately frozen and stored at -70 \u00b0C.","Extraction: To obtain the protein-free extracts of AH, VH and plasma, 4 volumes of 100% EtOH were added to 1 volume of thawed AH, VH and plasma samples.

In recent years, coregulators have begun to emerge as important regulators of metabolic homeostasis, including the p160 Steroid Receptor Coactivator (SRC) family. Members of the SRC family have been ascribed important roles in control of gluconeogenesis in liver and fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. To provide a deeper and more granular understanding of the metabolic impact of SRC family members, we have performed targeted metabolomics analysis of key metabolic byproducts of glucose, fatty acid, and amino acid metabolism in mice with global knockout of SRC-1, SRC-2, or SRC-3. We measured amino acids, acyl carnitines, and organic acids in five tissues with key metabolic functions (liver, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, plasma) isolated from SRC-1, -2, or -3 knockout mice and their wild-type littermates in the fed and fasted conditions, thereby unveiling unique metabolic functions of each SRC coactivator. Overall, we observed entire groups or subgroups of metabolites belonging to discrete metabolic pathways that were influenced in different tissues and\/or feeding states due to ablation of individual SRC isoforms. Surprisingly, we identified very few metabolites that changed universally across the three SRC knockout models. These findings demonstrate that coactivator function has very limited redundancy even within the homologous SRC coactivator family. Furthermore, this work also demonstrates the use of metabolomics as a means for identifying novel metabolic regulatory functions of transcriptional coregulators.","Sample collection: All animal experiments were performed according to protocols approved by the Animal Care Research Committee at Baylor College of Medicine. Generation of the SRC-1, SRC-2, and SRC-3 KO mice. SRC-1 KO was maintained in a pure C57BL\/6J genetic background, whereas SRC-2 and SRC-3 KO mice were maintained in a hybrid C57BL\/6J\/129 SV genetic background due to breeding issues of these two lines on a pure C57BL\/6J background. Only male, age-matched littermates (10-16 weeks old) mice were used in these studies. Animals were maintained in a temperature controlled (23 \u00b0C) facility with a 12-hr light\/dark cycle. Mice were fed 2920X Teklad Global rodent chow, and then studied either in the ad libitum fed state or following removal of food for 24 hr with free access to water. After fasting or ad libitum feeding, mice were weighed, and body temperature was measured using a digital rectal thermometer. Blood glucose was measured with using a hand-held glucometer (One Touch Ultra, Lifescan).","Extraction: Plasma Isolation: Whole blood was collected and transferred into a pre-chilled microcentrifuge tube containing 10 ml of 0.5 M EDTA (pH 8.0) for isolation of EDTA-plasma, which was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and stored at -80 \u00baC. Tissue Preparation: Frozen pieces of mouse liver, heart, skeletal muscle and whole brain tissue was pulverized with a liquid nitrogen-chilled 3 lb sledgehammer. The resulting pulverized tissue (~130 mg) was placed into a pre-chilled 14 ml tube, followed by the addition of 1.17 ml of pre-chilled HPLC-grade water. For cardiac tissue, frozen pieces of heart were pulverized as described above followed by the addition of pre-chilled 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing 0.3% formic acid. All samples were then homogenized on ice using a Polytron homogenizer. An aliquot of each homogenized tissue was used to perform a BCA protein concentration assay to normalize the resulting metabolites to total protein. The remainder of the homogenate was used to perform metabolomic profiling.","Chromatography: Gas chromatography: Organic acids were measured using stable isotope dilution techniques. They were quantified using a previously described method[1][2] using Trace GC Ultra operating under the manufacturer's software, Excalibur 1.4(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Austin, TX).

A model 2777 auto-sampler injected these entities into a model 1525 \u00b5 HPLC solvent delivery system under a data system controlled MassLynx 4.0 operating system (Waters, Milford, MA). For each tissue, 16 amino acids (TCA cycle intermediates and related analytes) were measured in liver, heart, skeletal muscle, brain, and EDTA-plasma. The numbers of acyl carnitine species analyzed for each tissue varied from tissue to tissue as some species of acyl carnitines are not detectable in all tissues. More specifically, 45 common acyl carnitine species were measured in liver, brain and plasma, respectively. A total of 52 acyl carnitines were measured in heart, while 55 were analyzed in skeletal muscle.

A two-way ANOVA was performed to compare the effects of feeding (fed vs. fasted), genotype (KO vs. WT), and the interaction between feeding and genotype across each set of metabolites. To compare only the effects of genotype for fasted and for fed mice separately, an ANOVA analysis with contrasts of each set of metabolites was performed. We used the Benjamini and Hochberg method for estimation of FDR (False Discovery Rate)[1]. The cut-offs for differentially expressed metabolites was FDR = 0.1. Zero values observed in the raw data were considered as missing. Metabolites with more than 10% missing data have been excluded from the analysis. Raw data values were log-transformed prior to analysis to establish distributions closer to the Gaussian. The total number of metabolites analyzed for each tissue was the following: plasma = 60; liver = 67; muscle = 77; brain = 67; heart = 74. The results are presented as heat maps and Venn diagrams. Heat maps were generated using dChip (www.dchip.org). Standardized z-scores of the log2-transformed values were used for heat maps of raw data with blue representing low z-score values and red representing high z-score values, respectively. The results of two-way ANOVA analyses were represented as heat maps, where blue indicates that the Fed group is significantly lower than Fast, or KO is significantly lower than WT; red represents the significant increase of Fed vs. Fast, or KO vs. WT. Pink indicates significant statistical interactions. ANOVA with contrasts results are represented as heat maps, where red indicates that KO is significantly higher than WT, and blue indicates that KO is significantly lower than WT.

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed non-targeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29\u00b14 yr) and 15 elderly (81\u00b17 yr) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV=standard deviation\/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found fourteen blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in anti-oxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson\u2019s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. While our CV values are mostly consistent with those previously published, we here report novel CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4-2.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values such as ATP and glutathione may be related to various diseases as their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health.

Fatty acid metabolite abundance was compared between locoregional (stage I-III) and liver metastatic (stage IV) cancer, as well as between all stages of colorectal cancer (stage I-IV) and disease-free controls. Reprogrammed energy metabolism is now listed as one of the central hallmarks of cancer cells. Aberrant fatty acid metabolism contributes to tumourigenesis through provision of substrates for membrane synthesis, signalling molecules, and synthesis of complex lipids. In this thesis, the role of fatty acid metabolism is explored in the context of colorectal cancer. Metabolomics techniques were employed to characterize fatty acid metabolites in serum, and lipogenic gene expression was quantified in tumour and normal tissues to investigate host response to cancer. Fatty acid metabolite abundance was increased in the serum of individuals with colorectal cancer, and a growth factor signalling axis and lipogenic transcription factor upstream of the endogenous fatty acid synthesis pathway were increased in colorectal liver metastases. It was concluded that liver metastases have an effect on growth factor production in the hepatic microenvironment, leading to increased signalling through a pathway that activates the lipogenic transcription factor that regulates fatty acid synthesis.","Sample collection: Serum samples were collected after 12 hr of fasting without further restrictions, other than disease diagnosis. Some patients had been receiving various types of chemotherapy while others had not been receiving any treatment at the time of collection. Serum was collected from stage II, III, and IV colorectal cancer patients at various labs within the hospital. Disease-free samples were collected at a different site. For the serum collection, a vial of blood was collected in the morning after 12 hr of fasting. The blood was allowed to clot for approximately 30 min and then centrifuged at 2000 rpm at room temperature for 15 min. 500 \u00b5l of serum was then immediately aliquoted into freezer tubes for storage at -80 \u00baC until use. Typically, 1500 \u00b5l of serum was available, so three tubes per patient were stored. Treatment information for each person is not available.

Typically, 1500 \u00b5l of serum was available, so three tubes per patient were stored.","Extraction: Samples were prepared by extracting the aqueous and organic phase of the serum sample using a standard chloroform:methanol:water extraction procedure. GC-MS derivatization: Metabolite extracts were evaporated to dryness in a fume hood. For chemical derivatization, the dried organic phase was dissolved in 750 \u00b5l of chloroform:methanol (1:1) under sonication for 15 min. 100 \u00b5l of tridecanoic acid-d25 (200 \u00b5g\/ml, Cambridge Isotopes Laboratories) was added as an internal standard to each sample. 125 \u00b5l of 14% boron trifluoride in methanol was added followed by incubation at 80 \u00baC for 90 min. Vials were left to cool for 10 min before adding 300 \u00b5l of H2O and 600 \u00b5l of hexane followed by vortexing. Aqueous layer was discarded, and organic layer was evaporated to dryness overnight. Samples were dissolved in 200 \u00b5l hexane prior to analysis by GC-MS. Analytical block construction: Serum samples were randomly divided into three batches with an equal number of each clinical stage (stage I\/ II\/ III\/ IV) and males\/females on each day. Age-and-gender matched disease-free controls were run in the same batch as their matching sample. Disease-free controls were matched as closely as possible with the age and gender of the patients but some exact age matches were not possible so the next closest age was used. One batch was run per 24 hr on the GC-MS.","Chromatography: Chromatography was carried out on a G3440A Agilent GC 7890A gas chromatograph. A DB-23 gas chromatography column (Agilent Technologies; 60 m x 0.25 mm x 0.15 \u00b5m film thickness) was used. A hexane blank and FAME 37 standard were run interspersed with the samples to monitor retention time variation.","Mass spec: Samples were analyzed using an Agilent GC coupled with a GCT Premier time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Waters). One microliter of each sample was injected in splitless mode and with the port temperature held at 240 \u00baC throughout analysis. The GC oven temperature program used was: initial hold at 50 \u00baC for 2 min, increase at 25 \u00baC\/min for 7 min to 175 \u00baC, followed by an increase of 4 \u00baC\/min until 250 \u00baC where the temperature was held for an additional two min, giving a total run time of 28 min. The time-of-flight mass spectrometer was operated in electron impact (EI) mode with a source temperature of 225 \u00baC and electron energy of 70 eV.

This study utilized an untargeted metabolomics approach to examine the metabolic perturbations that occur following two workload matched supramaximal low volume HIE trials. In a randomized order, 7 untrained males completed two exercise protocols separated by 1 week; (1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest; (2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest. Total exercise duration was 30 min for both trials. Blood samples were taken at rest, during and immediately following exercise and at 60 min post exercise. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of plasma identified 43 known metabolites of which 3 demonstrated significant fold changes (HIE300% compared to the HIE150% value) during exercise, 14 post exercise and 23 at the end of the recovery period. Significant changes in plasma metabolites relating to lipid metabolism [fatty acids: dodecanoate (p=0.042), hexadecanoate (p=0.001), octadecanoate (p=0.001)], total cholesterol (p=0.001), and glycolysis [lactate (p=0.018)] were observed following exercise and during the recovery period. The HIE300% protocol elicited greater metabolic changes relating to lipid metabolism and glycolysis when compared to HIE150% protocol. These changes were more pronounced throughout the recovery period rather than during the exercise bout itself. Data from the current study demonstrate the use of metabolomics to monitor intensity-dependent changes in multiple metabolic pathways following exercise. The small sample size indicates a need for further studies in a larger sample cohort to validate these findings.","Sample collection: Seven healthy recreationally active males (22.9 \u00b1 5.0 year; 81.6 \u00b1 4.9 kg; 178.7 \u00b1 4.5 cm; 50.0 \u00b1 6.1 ml kg\/min VO2peak) were asked to complete two supramaximal low volume, high intensity exercise (HIE) protocols in a randomized order and separated by at least one week: 1) HIE150%: 30 x 20 s cycling at 150% VO2peak, 40 s passive rest (348 \u00b1 27 W); 2) HIE300%: 30 x 10 s cycling at 300% VO2peak, 50 s passive rest (697 \u00b1 54 W). Exercise trials were 30 min in duration and workload matched by manipulating exercise intensity and the duration of cycling and rest intervals. HIE was preceded by a rest period and followed by 60 min passive recovery in a supine position. Blood was sampled at rest, 10 min into exercise (EX10), immediately after exercise (EX30) and at the end of the 60 min recovery period (RC60). Samples were immediately placed into lithium heparin tubes and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 2 min. Plasma was decanted and stored at -80 \u00b0C for later GCMS analysis.","Extraction: 50 \u00b5l of each lithium heparin treated plasma sample was diluted with 150 \u00b5l of MeOH [spiked with 4% 13C6-Sorbitol as an extraction internal standard (ISTD)]. The samples were briefly vortexed and placed on ice for 10 min prior to being centrifuged at 13,200 rpm for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to precipitate any protein present. 100 \u00b5l supernatant was separated and transferred into 6 mm diameter conical bottom glass vial inserts that had been placed inside eppendorf vials. An additional 10 \u00b5l supernatant from each extracted sample was combined into a separate eppendorf vial, which was vortexed and used to create 5 x 100 \u00b5l pooled biological quality control (PBQC) glass vial inserts. Eppendorf vials containing inserts were then dried in vacuo at a temperature of -55 \u00b0C and pressure of 3 mbar for 2 hr. Glass vial inserts were then placed into 2 ml wide top glass vials and covered with metallic crimp caps (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA).

A Gerstal Technologies MPS2XL GC-MS autosampler was set to select samples for analysis in a randomized order. MeOX and TMS derivatized samples were injected onto the GC column using a hot needle technique. The injection was operated in both a splitless (1 ul sample) and split (0.20 ul sample) modes to avoid overloaded chromatogram peaks. An inlet temperature of 230\u00b0C and helium was used as the carrier gas with a flow rate of 1 ml per min along a 30 m VF-5MS column with 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness, and a 10 m Integra guard column, for chromatographic separation.","Mass spec: The GC-MS system used comprised of a 7890A Agilent gas chromatograph triple-quadrupole and a 5975C Agilent triple-axis mass selective detector (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, USA).

A random PBQC was used for data filtering (to remove background noise), deconvolution (to align peaks and correct for retention time drifts between runs) and peak detection (via characteristics of each ion including m\/z ratio, retention time and ion intensity). Using the in house Metabolomics Australia (University of Melbourne, Australia) mass spectra library the mass spectra was then additionally verified by analysis of reference standard compounds.

In this work, first a liquid chromatography method that requires minimal sample preparation and can measure both free and conjugated sesquiterpene lactones was developed. Then the most common sample preparation techniques used in the past studies (e.g., solid-phase extraction, liquid\/liquid extraction) were evaluated and shown to introduce significant bias against the polar oxalyl-terpenes. Finally the method was applied to a case study, highlighting the effect of variety, duration and temperature of forcing on the sesquiterpene lactone content of Belgian endive.","Sample collection: Belgian endive was field-grown and forced at the experimental station Inagro vzw (Rumbeke-Beitem, Belgium). Three varieties were used in this study: Takine, Symphonie, and Vintor. Roots were harvested on 19\/11\/2013, and subsequently forced following an experimental design including three forcing temperatures (11, 16, and 21 \u02daC) and three forcing periods (14, 21, and 28 d). The combinations of 14 d at 11 \u02daC and 28 d at 21 \u02daC were not implemented as they would not produce chicons fit for consumption. Forcing started on 27\/5\/2014 (for 28 days of forcing), 3\/6\/2014 (21 days) or 10\/6\/2014 (14 days). All chicons were harvested on 24\/6\/2014 and kept refrigerated at 4 \u02daC. During the two following days, ten chicons were randomly chosen per condition for sampling. After removing the two external leaves, the remaining leaves were separated from the pit with a knife, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground to a fine powder in a CryoMill grindomixer MM200 (Retsch, Germany).

Using two extraction procedures, metabolomic approaches were used to investigate changes in the metabolome of C. asiatica cells treated with exogenous MeJA. GC\u2013MS and LC\u2013MS platforms were employed for semi-targeted and untargeted analyses, respectively. Multivariate data analyses indicated concentration-dependent changes in the metabolite profiles, indicative of the cellular response to MeJA. Annotation of biomarkers correlated with the treatment indicate differential responses in flavonoid-, phenylpropanoid (cinnamates)- and terpenoid pathways and changes in fatty acid profiles. MeJA treatment triggered the accumulation of bicyclic sesquiterpenoids (aristolochene, deoxy-capsidiol, 15-hydroxysolavetivone, solavetivone, 3-hydroxylubimin) and a tricyclic sesquiterpenoid (phytuberin), indicating the stimulatory effect of MeJA on this branch of the terpenoid pathways. In contrast, flavonoids were mostly negatively correlated with the treatment. The presence of the sesquiterpenoids in MeJA-elicited cells and other tentatively identified metabolites (abscisic acid, fatty acids, phytosterols and metabolites of shikimate\u2013phenylpropanoid pathways) indicates that the changes in the metabolome are associated with a defensive function in response to elicitation by MeJA, rather than just the amplification of existing terpene pathways. These results provide a detailed and comprehensive picture of metabolic changes occurring in C. asiatica cells in response to MeJA elicitation and contribute to the understanding of flexible and controllable aspects of metabolic manipulation.","Sample collection: Plant material and cell cultures were obtaines and prepared as described previously [1][2]. Briefly, commercially cultivated C. asiatica was obtained from a local nursery. Explants from stems were cultivated and maintained in agar solidified Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with vitamins (50 mg nicotinic acid, 50 mg thiamine HCl, 10 mg pyridoxine HCl and 10 g myo-inositol per 100 ml, Highveld Biologicals, South Africa) supplemented with 1 \u00b5M 2,4-D, 1 \u00b5M BAP, 30 g\/l sucrose and 1 g\/l casein hydrolysate. To obtain callus proliferation, 1 g of callus was transferred aseptically to solid MS salt solution as described above. The cultures were kept in a culture room with 18\/6 h light\/dark cycle and the temperature was regulated at 23 \u00b0C for 21 days. In addition, callus was transferred to sterile liquid medium, to initiate cell suspensions. These were incubated on an orbital shaker in the dark at 23 \u00b0C. Every 7 days the homogenous cell suspension was subcultured in a 1:1 (v\/v) ratio with fresh MS medium. For elicitation of cells, C. asiatica cell suspensions were treated by the application of MeJA (Sigma Aldrich, Munich, Germany) to obtain final concentrations of 100, 200 and 400 \u00b5M and incubated for 24 h with continuous rotation at 120 rpm and 25 \u00b0C. Non-treated C. asiatica cell suspensions, incubated in the same conditions as the MeJA-treated cells, were used as negative controls. All results are based on four biological repeats, with three analytical replicates for each biological repeat.

Chloroform extracts were prepared as previously described, using the dispersive liquid-liquid microextraction (DLLME) method [1]. Briefly, 24 h post treatment, the excess media was filtered using a Buchner funnel and the cells were collected. 2 g of cells were re-suspended in 20 ml of methanol and homogenised using an Ultra Turrax homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 5525 x g for 7 min at 25 \u00b0C. The supernatants were placed into 50 ml round-bottom flasks, and the methanol evaporated to 1 ml at 50 \u00b0C using a Buchi Rotavapor R-200. To this, 1 ml of the crude aqueous extract, 200 \u00b5l of chloroform and 100 \u00b5l of methanol were added. The mixture was vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 6 min at 25 \u00b0C in a glass centrifuge tube. Using a syringe, the bottom chloroform extraction layer was removed and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m nylon filters, and placed into pre-labelled GC glass vials containing glass inserts and fitted with slitted caps. A general methanol extraction was carried out as previously described, with modification where necessary [2][3]. The resulting 50% methanol extracts were filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m filters and placed into pre-labelled UHPLC glass vials fitted with inserts and slitted caps.

PLoS ONE 9:e87846. doi:10.1371\/journal.pone.0087846 ","Chromatography: GC-MS: The DLLME chloroform extracts were analysed on a Shimadzu GC\u2013MS-QP2010 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with an electron-impact (EI) ion source and a quadrupole mass analyser. The chromatographic separation was achieved on a ZB1-MS non-polar column (Phenomenex, Tottance, CA, USA). A 1 \u00b5l aliquot of chloroform sample was injected into the GC-MS instrument in splitless mode and the injection temperature of 250 \u00b0C. The overall programmed-temperature GC run included zones with different temperature gradient (multi-linear programming) with initial and final isothermal zones. The initial GC oven temperature was 40 \u00b0C for 4 min, increased by 25 \u00b0C\/min to 240 \u00b0C, then increased to 300 \u00b0C at a rate of 5 \u00b0C\/min and held at 300 \u00b0C for 5.00 min LC-MS: UHPLC and high-definition mass spectrometry (UHPLC\u2013HDMS) analyses were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC coupled in tandem to a Waters photodiode array(PDA) detector and a SYNAPT G1 HDMS Q-TOF mass spectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK). Chromatographic separation of methanol extracts was done utilising a Waters CSH C18 Acquity column (150 mm x 2.1 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m) thermostatted at 60 \u00b0C. A binary solvent mixture was used consisting of water (eluent A) containing 10 mM formic acid (pH 2.3) and acetonitrile (Romil Pure Chemistry, Cambridge, UK) (eluent B). The initial conditions were 95% A at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min and were kept constant for 2 min. A gradient was introduced to change the chromatographic conditions to 5% A at 22 min. The conditions were kept constant for 3 min to flush the analytical column where after the column was returned to initial conditions at 27 min and allowed to equilibrate for 3 min. The run time was 30 min and the injection volume was 5 \u00b5l. Each sample was analysed in triplicate, to account for any analytical variability. The PDA detector was scanned between 200 and 500 nm (1.2 nm resolution) and collecting 20 spectra\/s.","Mass spec: GC-MS: The MS was operated using EI at 70 eV. Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the column flow rate set at 1 ml\/min. The ion source temperature was set at 200 \u00b0C, and the detector voltage was set at 0.5 kV to prevent the oversaturation of the detector. The solvent cut time for the MS was set at 5 min and EI scan mode was used for identification covering the range of 50-500 m\/z. LC-MS: The SYNAPT G1 mass spectrometer was used in V-optics and operated in electrospray ionisation (ESI) mode to detect the compounds of interest. Leucine enkephalin (50 pg\/ml) was used as reference calibrant to obtain typical mass accuracies between 1 and 3 mDa. The mass spectrometer was operated in both positive and negative mode with a capillary voltage of 2.5 kV, the sampling cone at 17 V and the extraction cone at 4 V. The scan time was 0.1 s covering the 100 to 1000 Da mass range. The source temperature was 120\u00b0C and the desolvation temperature was set at 450 \u00b0C. Nitrogen gas was used as the nebulisation gas at a flow rate of 800 l\/h. The software used to control the hyphenated system and perform all data manipulation was MassLynx 4.1 (SCN 704, Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA).","Data transformation: The raw data was processed using the software specific to the analytical platform used. GC-MS: For GC-MS data, the Profiling Solution software (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) was used for data processing. The parameters were default settings except for the following: 6-25 min retention time (Rt) range of the chromatogram, ion m\/z tolerance of 500 mDa, ion Rt tolerance of 0.5 min and ion intensity threshold of 1000 counts. The timebase \u2018Warping\u2019 method was used for the chromatogram alignment. The data matrices obtained from Profiling Solution processing were exported to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis \/ orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). LC-MS: For LC-MS data, ESI positive and negative raw data were extracted using MassLynxTM XS software and analysed with MarkerLynxTM software (Waters Corporation, Mildford, MA, USA). The MarkerLynx software extracts the raw LC-MS data and produces a matrix of Rt-m\/z variable pairs, with the m\/z peak intensity for each sample. Software parameters were set to analyse the 2-26 min Rt range of the chromatogram, mass range 100-700 Da, mass tolerance 0.01 Da, mass window 0.05 Da and a Rt window of 0.20 min. The data matrices obtained from MarkerLynx processing were exported to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) for principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal projection to latent structures-discriminant analysis\/orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). XCMS analyses of LC-MS data: Following the upload of the raw data files (netCDF), parameters for XCMS processing were as follows: centWave for feature detection (with 15 ppm as a maximal tolerated m\/z deviation in consecutive scans, minimum chromatographic peak width of 5 s and maximum peak width of 20 s); obwarp method for retention time correction (profStep = 1, step size to use for profile generation). The chromatogram alignment parameters included: minfrac of 0.5 (minimum fraction of samples necessary in at least one of the sample groups for it to be a valid group), bw of 5 s (allowable retention time deviations) and mzwid of 0.015 (width of overlapping m\/z slices to use for peak density chromatograms and grouping peaks across samples). The relative quantification of metabolite features was based on EIC (extracted ion chromatogram) areas, and statistical test was performed using unpaired parametric t-test (Welch t-test) method, with p-value and fold change thresholds of 0.01 and 1.5 respectively for highly significant features and p-value threshold of 0.05 for significant features.","Metabolite id: The selected mass ions from the SIMCA-derived S- and Variable Importance in Projection (VIP) plots were putatively annotated according to the Metabolomic Standards Initiative, level 2 [1]. For the LC-MS platform, selected mass ions obtained from MarkerLynx data were putatively identified using the Taverna workbench (www.taverna.org.uk) for PUTMEDID_LCMS metabolite identification workflows. The Taverna workflows allow for integrated, automated and high-throughput annotation and putative metabolite identification from LC-ESI-MS metabolomic data. The workflows consist of correlation analysis, metabolic feature annotation and metabolite annotation [2]. For the GC-EI-MS platform, the respective mass spectra of the extracted ion peaks of the selected mass ions from S- and VIP plots were searched against the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and Wiley mass spectra libraries (2007 versions) for similarity matches. This spectral comparison provided putative empirical formulae and structures, which were further searched in databases such as the Dictionary of Natural Products (www.dnp.chemnetbase.com) and ChemSpider (www.chemspider.com). The library search results were evaluated based on the probability factor, a match factor provided by the search algorithms that describes how unique a spectrum is, compared to all other spectra in the library [3][4]. Only spectra with probability hits in the range from 650 to 900 or above, were considered. The statistically selected features in XCMS analyses are automatically annotated by searching the METLIN metabolite database, producing thus a list of putative identities based on accurate mass measurements. In this study, the XCMS online annotation parameters were set as follows: isotopes and adducts search, m\/z absolute error of 0, ppm error of 5 and the tolerance for database search of 10 ppm.

Patients were treated with Etomidate or Propofol, two frequently used sedation agents. Plasma samples were obtained via Ficoll separation. Here, we demonstrated that this procedure introduces a number of limitations for NMR-based metabolomics studies, due to the appearance of spurious signals. Nevertheless, the comparison of the 1H NMR metabolomic profiles of patients treated with Etomidate or Propofol at equipotent dose ranges was still feasible and proved that both agents significantly decrease the plasma levels of several NMR-detectable metabolites. Consequently, samples collected during anesthesia are not suitable for metabolic profiling studies aimed at patient stratification, because interpersonal variability are reduced by the overall depression of metabolites levels. On the other hand, this study showed that plasma metabolomics could represent a valuable tool to monitor the effect of different sedation agents and\/or the individual metabolic response to anesthesia, providing hints for an appropriate tuning of personalized sedation procedures. In our reference groups, the metabolomic signatures were slightly different in patients anesthetized with Etomidate versus Propofol. The importance of standardized collection procedures and availability of exhaustive metadata of the experimental design for the accurate evaluation of the significance of the observed changes in metabolites levels are critically discussed.","Sample collection: Seventy tumour patients, 32 female and 38 male, over 18 years of age, 40 with confirmed colorectal cancer and 30 with confirmed liver metastasis from colorectal cancer, were recruited for this study. For each subject, blood was collected twice, the first time prior to the administration of the anesthesia and the second time when the patient was fully anesthetized, but before the surgery. All blood samples were drawn from the central infusion line and the blood was collected into commercially available EDTA-treated vials. All vials were bandaged with an absorbent cloth, stored in a polythene bag and then immediately transferred at 4 \u00b0C.","Extraction: Plasma samples were obtained according to Indivumed standard operating procedures: EDTA-plasma was separated from the entire blood by a density gradient centrifugation using the Ficoll-Paque and a Leucosep Tube allowing also the separation of the mononuclear cells lymphocytes used for other aims.

A total of 450 \u00b5l of this mixture was transferred into a 4.25 mm NMR tube (Bruker BioSpin srl) for analysis. Ref: [1] Bernini P, Bertini I, Luchinat C, Nincheri P, Staderini S, Turano P.

PMID:21380509 ","Nmr spec: Monodimensional 1H NMR spectra for all samples were acquired using a Bruker 600 MHz metabolic profiler (Bruker BioSpin) operating at 600.13 MHz proton Larmor frequency and equipped with a 5 mm CPTCI 1H-13C-31P and 2H-decoupling cryoprobe including a z axis gradient coil, an automatic tuning-matching and an automatic sample changer. A BTO 2000 thermocouple served for temperature stabilization at the level of approximately 0.1 K at the sample. Before measurement, samples were kept for at least 3 min inside the NMR probe head, for temperature equilibration (300 K).","Nmr assay: For each sample, monodimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a standard Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) [1] (cpmgpr1d.comp; Bruker BioSpin) pulse sequence, using 64 scans, 73,728 data points, a spectral width of 12,019 Hz and a relaxation delay of 4 s.

","Data transformation: Free induction decays were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a 1.0 Hz line-broadening factor before applying Fourier transform. Transformed spectra were automatically corrected for phase and baseline distortions and calibrated (glucose doublet at 5.24 ppm) using TopSpin 2.1 (Bruker Biospin srl). Each spectrum in the range between 0.20 and 10.00 ppm was segmented into 0.02-ppm chemical shift bins, and the corresponding spectral areas were integrated using the AMIX software (Bruker BioSpin). Regions between 6.00 and 3.30 ppm containing residual water signal and the broad and intense absorption attributable to the Ficoll contamination were excluded in subsequent statistical analyses. The total spectral area was calculated on the remaining bins and total area normalization was carried out on the data prior to pattern recognition.","Metabolite id: Various kinds of multivariate and univariate statistical techniques were applied on the obtained buckets using R 3.0.2 in house scripts. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to obtain a preliminary outlook of the data (visualization in a reduced space, clusters detection, screening for outliers), partial least squares (PLS) and multilevel PLS (MPLS) were employed to perform supervised data reduction and classification. Canonical analysis (CA) was used in combination with PLS to increase the supervised separation of the analyzed groups. Accuracy, specificity and sensitivity were estimated according to standard definitions. The global accuracy for classification was assessed by means of a Monte carlo cross-validation scheme. Twenty metabolites (plus the antibiotic Cefuroxime), whose peaks in the spectra were well defined and resolved, were assigned. Signal identification was performed using a library of NMR spectra of pure organic compounds, public databases (such as HMBD, human metabolic database, and SDBS, spectra database for organic compounds) storing reference NMR spectra of metabolites, spiking NMR experiments and literature data [1]. The relative concentrations of the various metabolites in the different spectra were calculated by integrating the signal area [2]. The Wilcoxon test was used for the determination of the meaningful metabolites. False discovery rate correction was applied using the Benjamini & Hochberg method (FDR) [3]: an adjusted p value of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The changes in metabolites levels between two groups of spectra are calculated as the log2 fold change (FC) ratio of the normalized median intensities of the corresponding signals in the spectra of the two groups (Fold change). When two groups were constituted by individuals that could be compared in pairs (e.g. the same individual before and after anesthesia) a pairwise analysis was performed. Pairwise Wilcoxon test (univariate statistics) and multilevel PLS [4][5] were used to this purpose. Ref: [1] Psychogios N, Hau DD, Peng J, et al. The human serum metabolome.

However, there are no reports that describe their appropriate taxonomic classification rank. Moreover, studies differ on the taxonomic ranking of the same microorganism. Intestinal microbiome exerts a significant degree of influence on the host via the metabolome. In the present study, we searched for their appropriate classification ranks based on the correlation between the metabolome and microbiome. Over 200 metabolites were identified by capillary electrophoresis and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS) based metabolomics of faeces from antibiotics-treated and untreated mice. Nine phyla, 15 orders, 22 classes, 40 families, and 59 genera were identified by 16S metagenomic analysis. Principle component analysis (PCA) of the intestinal microbiome at each taxonomic rank revealed differences between the antibiotic-treated and untreated groups on the first principle component in the family and genus-level analyses. These differences were similar to those found in the metabolome PCA. In addition, a strong correlation between principle component score of the metabolome and that of the microbiome was observed in the case of family and genus-level analyses. From these results, we hypothesize that lower taxonomic ranks such as family or genus are preferable while using 16S metagenome analysis for investigating the crosstalk, via metabolites, between intestinal microbiome and the host.","Sample collection: Eight-week-old male C57BL\/6 mice were purchased from Clea Japan, Inc.

In the first, aerobic capacity (VO2max) was determined and the second was a 45 min submaximal exercise test. Urine samples were collected separately the day before (day 1), the day of (day 2), and the day after (day 3) the submaximal exercise test (12 samples per subject). Metabolomic profiling of the samples was carried out using hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) coupled to an Orbitrap Exactive mass spectrometer. Data were extracted, database searched and then subjected to principle components (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares (OPLSDA) modelling. The best results were obtained from pre-treating the data by normalising the metabolites to their mean output on days 1 and 2 of the trial. This allowed PCA to separate the day 2 first void samples (D2S1) from the day 2 post-exercise samples (D2S3) PCA also separated the equivalent samples obtained on day 1 (D1S1 and D1S3). OPLSDA modelling separated both the D2S1 and D2S3 samples and D1S1 and D1S3 samples. The metabolites affected by the exercise samples included a range of purine metabolites and several acyl carnitines. Some metabolites were subject to diurnal variation these included bile acids and several amino acids, the variation of these metabolites was similar on day 1 and day 2 despite the exercise intervention on day 2. Using OPLS modelling it proved possible to identify a single abundant urinary metabolite provisionally identified as oxo-aminohexanoic acid (OHA) as being strongly correlated with VO2max when the levels in the D2S3 samples were considered.","Sample collection: 10 healthy recreationally active adults, 2 female and 8 male, visited the laboratory on 2 separate occasions to complete 2 cycling exercise trials. The first was an incremental exercise test until exhaustion in order to determine aerobic capacity (VO2max) and the second was a 45 min submaximal exercise test. Urine samples were collected the day before, the day of, and the day after the submaximal exercise test. Participants were asked not to exercise 24 hr prior to the maximal test and for the duration of the urine collection period other than the submaximal trial. They were also asked to refrain from the consumption of alcohol 24 hr before each test, caffeine for 6 hr before testing, or consume anything other than water for 3 hr before testing.","Extraction: Coded pre-labelled sterilised urine containers were distributed to the subjects. A designated drop-off point was designated for the samples.

The instrumental variation was also minimised by running the 12 samples for each subject in blocks. Since the final normalisation is subject specific, rather than being based on the full cohort this reduces the impact of technical variations in a long run. Samples are designated as follows D = day, S= sample number within a day e.g. D1S1 = day1 sample 1. Pooled samples were interspersed throughout the run to check for technical variation. Within the blocks of 12 the samples the samples were randomised. 4 standard mixtures containing 200 standards were run also after the samples.","Chromatography: LC-MS data were acquired on an Dionex 3000 HPLC (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK) coupled to an Exactive Orbitrap (Thermo Fisher Scientific), controlled by Xcalibur version 2.1.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Hemel Hempstead, UK).

The most significant changes occurred during the first 15 min, when trehalose, 2-oxoglutarate, and succinate increased, while purine biosynthesis intermediates rapidly diminished. At 30\u201360 min, free amino acids decreased, although several modified amino acids\u2014including hercynylcysteine sulfoxide, a precursor to ergothioneine\u2014accumulated. Most high-energy metabolites such as ATP, S-adenosyl-methionine or NAD+ remained stable during the whole time course. Very rapid metabolic changes such as the shut-off of purine biosynthesis and the rise of 2-oxoglutarate and succinate can be explained by the depletion of NH4Cl. The changes in the levels of key metabolites, particularly 2-oxoglutarate, might represent an important mechanistic step to trigger subsequent cellular regulations.","Sample collection: The fission yeast S. pombe heterothallic haploid 972 h- wild-type strain was used for the experiments. Cells were incubated in the EMM2 liquid medium at 26 \u00b0C in a water bath with shaking. Cell concentration in the culture was measured by the CDA-500 particle counter (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan). For metabolome analysis, cells were grown to the log phase and at the concentration of 5 \u00d7 106 cells\/ml, 40 ml of culture was taken as 0 min sample. The rest of culture was N-starved by switching the medium with EMM2-N (EMM2 without NH4Cl) following the procedures previously described [1]. After N-starvation, cells were incubated again in the water bath at 26 \u00b0C, and after 15, 30, 60 min, 40 ml of culture was taken.

All experiments were performed with 32 scans, a 10 ms mixing time, and 96,000 data points at a temperature of 310 K.","Nmr assay: The serum samples were analysed using 1H-NMR spectroscopy with two different pulse sequences. The first, the so-called noesy-presat sequence, provides an overview of all proton-containing species and yields sharp peaks for small molecule species, broad bands from the lipoproteins (used later for lipoprofile analysis, see below) and a broad largely featureless-background from proteins, the most abundant being albumin. The second pulse sequence, the so-called Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG) sequence, takes advantage of the different nuclear spin relaxation times between large and small molecules to attenuate the peaks from large molecules (those with shorter spin-spin relaxation times) to leave mainly small molecule metabolite peaks. The main data analysis was performed using the CPMG spectral data and the lipoprotein profiling was carried out using the noesy-presat spectral data. For the CPMG spectra a relaxation delay (RD) of 4 s, a mixing time of 0.01 s, a spin-echo delay of 0.3 ms, 128 loops and a free induction decay (FID) acquisition time (ACQ) of 3.067 s were used. A total of 32 scans were recorded into 96k data points with a spectral width of 20 ppm.","Data transformation: The acquired 1H-NMR spectra were zero-filled to 128 k points, Fourier transformed, phase and baseline corrected using Bruker Topspin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The serum spectra were referenced to the anomeric proton assigned to \u03b1-glucose at \u03b45.22 and imported to MATLABTM (R2014a, The Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) for further analysis. Regions corresponding to the water peak (\u03b44.3 to 4.925) were removed. All spectra were normalized using probabilistic quotient normalization using the mean spectrum as the reference.","Metabolite id: Multivariate principal component analysis was used to examine the data sets and to observe clustering in the results according to predefined classes. Univariate logistic regression was performed, adjusting for confounding factors between never-smokers and smokers with class variables (body mass index (BMI), gender, drug intake and age) for each MS feature in the data sets.

Eflornithine, a polyamine pathway inhibitor, and nifurtimox, whose mode of action involves its metabolic activation, are currently used in combination as first line treatment against stage 2, CNS-involved, human African trypanosomiasis (HAT). Drug action was assessed using an LC-MS based non-targeted metabolomics approach. Eflornithine revealed the expected changes to the polyamine pathway as well as several unexpected changes that point to pathways and metabolites not previously described in bloodstream form trypanosomes, including a lack of arginase activity and N-acetylated ornithine and putrescine. Nifurtimox was shown to be converted to a trinitrile metabolite indicative of metabolic activation, as well as inducing changes in levels of metabolites involved in carbohydrate and nucleotide metabolism. However, eflornithine and nifurtimox failed to synergise anti-trypanosomal activity in vitro, and the metabolomic changes associated with the combination are the sum of those found in each monotherapy with no indication of additional effects. The study reveals how untargeted metabolomics can yield rapid information on drug targets that could be adapted to any pharmacological situation.","Sample collection: Bloodstream form trypanosomes were grown in HMI-9 (Biosera)[1] supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum (Biosera), incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2.

The Alamar blue assay described previously[2] for bloodstream form trypanosomes was used to determine activity of drugs against T. brucei strain 427. For isobologram analyses, alamar blue assays were conducted for one drug in the presence of three different concentrations (IC50, 2x IC50 and 0.5x IC50) of another drug. Cultures were kept in log phase growth (below 1 x 10^6\/ml) in the presence of drug. At the time of harvest, 4 x 10^7 cells were rapidly cooled to 4 \u00b0C to quench metabolism by submersion of the flask in a dry ice-ethanol bath, and kept on ice for all subsequent steps. The cold cell culture was centrifuged at 1,250 RCF for 10 min and the supernatant completely removed. For heavy metabolite tracking analyses, log phase cells were centrifuged 1,250 RCF for 10 min and resuspended in CBSS (20 mM HEPES, 120 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 0.55 mM CaCl2, 0.4 mM MgSO4, 5.6 mM Na2HPO4, 11.1 mM glucose) or HMI-9.

antibiotics discovered through phenotypic screening is of increasing importance. Metabolomics offers a potentially rapid and cost-effective means of identifying modes of action of drugs whose effects are mediated through changes in metabolism. Metabolomics techniques also collect data on off-target effects and drug modifications. Here, we present data from an untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach to identify the modes of action of eight compounds: 1-[3-fluoro-4-(5-methyl-2,4-dioxo-pyrimidin-1-yl)phenyl]-3-[2-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]urea (AZ1), 2-(cyclobutylmethoxy)-5'-deoxyadenosine, triclosan, fosmidomycin, CHIR-090, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), 5-chloro-2-(methylsulfonyl)-N-(1,3-thiazol-2-yl)-4-pyrimidinecarboxamide (AZ7), and ceftazidime. Data analysts were blind to the compound identities but managed to identify the target as thymidylate kinase for AZ1, isoprenoid biosynthesis for fosmidomycin, acyl-transferase for CHIR-090, and DNA metabolism for 2-(cyclobutylmethoxy)-5'-deoxyadenosine. Changes to cell wall metabolites were seen in ceftazidime treatments, although other changes, presumably relating to off-target effects, dominated spectral outputs in the untargeted approach. Drugs which do not work through metabolic pathways, such as the proton carrier CCCP, have no discernible impact on the metabolome. The untargeted metabolomics approach also revealed modifications to two compounds, namely, fosmidomycin and AZ7. An untreated control was also analyzed, and changes to the metabolome were seen over 4 h, highlighting the necessity for careful controls in these types of studies. Metabolomics is a useful tool in the analysis of drug modes of action and can complement other technologies already in use.","Sample collection: A 10-ml overnight culture of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0was inoculated into 40 ml of cation-adjusted MHB (no preincubation) or a 2-ml overnight culture of\u00a0E. coli\u00a0was inoculated into 48 ml of cation-adjusted MHB (with preincubation) and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 37\u00b0C. For assays without a preincubation step, the extractions were started at this point; for assays with a preincubation step, the cells were incubated for 2 h before extractions were started. Drugs were added at 4\u00d7 MIC, and samples were taken at 0, 2, and 4 h after drug addition. Samples were cooled to 5\u00b0C in a dry-ice\u2013ethanol bath to rapidly quench metabolism before they were transferred to ice. Ten milliliters of cells was pelleted at 3,000 relative centrifugal force (RCF), washed in 10 ml cold 0.85% NaCl, and then resuspended in 1 ml 0.85% NaCl. The OD590\u00a0of this cell suspension was taken and adjusted to 1.","Extraction: For metabolite extractions, one milliliter of cells was pelleted and resuspended in 200 \u03bcl chloroform-methanol-water (1:3:1, by volume) (plus theophylline, 5-fluorouridine,\u00a0N-methylglucamine, canavanine, and piperazine, all at 1 \u03bcM as internal standards). Samples were subjected to four freeze-thaw cycles in the dry-ice\u2013ethanol bath with regular vortexing before a final centrifugation at 16,000 RCF. The supernatant was taken and kept at \u221280\u00b0C under argon. For lipid extractions, one milliliter of cells was pelleted and moved in a minimal volume of NaCl to a glass vial to which 400 \u03bcl 2:1 chloroform-methanol by volume was added using a glass pipette. Samples were shaken for 10 min at room temperature, and 125 \u03bcl NaCl was added. Samples were vortexed and then left at room temperature for 20 min. The bottom layer was removed and placed in a glass vial to be stored under argon gas at 4\u00b0C.","Chromatography: A U3000 RSLC HPLC (Dionex) with a ZIC-HILIC or ZIC-pHILIC column (Sequant) was used to separate metabolite mixtures. The HPLC mobile phase gradient for ZIC-HILIC was as follows: Solvent A is 0.1% formic acid in water, and solvent B is 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile, 80% B (0 min), 50% B (12 min), 50% B (26 min), 20% B (28 min), 20% B (36 min), 80% B (37 min), 80% B (47 min). Lipid analysis was done using a C30 column (3 \u03bcm, 3 by 150 mm) (Thermo Dionex).","Mass spec: Samples were analysed on an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) in both positive and negative modes (rapid switching) or a QExactive. An Orbitrap Velos was used for lipid analyses. Fragmentation of pHILIC column-separated metabolites was performed in a data-dependent manner on the Q Exactive (Thermo Scientific) mass spectrometer, with the five most intense ions picked in a 4 m\/z exclusion window and at a collision energy of 65.

The modification of established cell culture methods to be more biologically relevant, or to optimise growth, is traditionally a laborious task. Emerging metabolomics technology enables rapid evaluation of intra- and extra-cellular metabolites, and can be applied to the rational development of cell culture medium. In this study, untargeted semi-quantitative, and targeted quantitative, metabolomic analyses of fresh and spent media revealed the major nutritional requirements for growth of bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei. The standard culture medium (HMI11) contained unnecessarily high concentrations of 32 nutrients that were subsequently removed to more closely resemble concentrations normally found in blood. Our new minimal medium (CMM) supports in vitro growth equivalent to HMI11, and causes no significant perturbation of metabolite levels for 94% of the detected metabolome (< 3-fold change; a = 0.05). Importantly, improved sensitivity was observed for drug activity studies in whole cell phenotypic screens, and in metabolomics mode of action assays. 400-fold decreases in IC50 were observed for pentamidine and methotrexate, suggesting inhibition of activity by nutrients present in HMI11. CMM is suitable for routine cell culture and offers important advantages for metabolomics studies and drug activity screening.","Sample collection: Bloodstream-form Trypanosoma brucei brucei (s427) were cultured in vitro in either HMI11 (Gibco), CMM or modified media with 10% FCS Gold (PAA). Cell culture grade (or high purity) D-glucose, L-cysteine, L-glutamine and all other medium components were purchased from Sigma Aldrich. 5 ml cultures were maintained in 25 ml vented flasks (Corning) at 37 \u00baC with 5% CO2. Cultures were grown to a maximum density of 4 x 106 cells\/ml and sub-cultured by 1 in 100 or 1 in 1000 dilution, every 2 or 3 days, respectively. Cell counts were obtained by haemocytometer (Neubauer).","Extraction: Metabolite extraction was performed according to previously described methods [1][2]. 25 ml of cell culture was quenched by rapid cooling to 4 \u00baC in a dry ice\/ethanol bath. Cell pellets were obtained by centrifugation at 1250 x g for 10 minutes, and 5 \u00b5l spent media was removed and extracted by addition of 100 \u00b5l chloroform\/methanol\/water (1:3:1). The remaining cell pellet was washed with 1 ml PBS, and the washed pellet (5 \u00d7 107 cells) was extracted with 100 \u00b5l chloroform\/methanol\/water (1:3:1) by mixing for 1 h at 4 \u00baC, before centrifugation to remove precipitate. The resulting metabolite solution was stored at -80 \u00baC until analysis by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Comparative data from HMI11 and CMM cell pellets and spent media are from 5 independent biological replicates.

bioinformatics resources for the integrative analysis of multiple types of 'omics data. These resources include both novel statistical methodologies as well as user-friendly software implementations. STATegra methods address many aspects of the 'omics data integration problem such as the design of multi-omics experiments, integrative transcriptional and regulatory networks, integrative variable selection, data fusion, integration of public domain data, and integrative pathway analysis. To support method development STATegra uses a model biological system, namely the differentiation process of mouse pre-B-cells. The STATegra consortium generated data focused on a critical step in the differentiation of B lymphocytes, which are key components of the adaptive immune system. Transcription factors of the Ikaros family are central to the normal differentiation of B cell progenitors and their expression increases in response to developmental stage-specific signals to terminate the proliferation of B cell progenitors and to initiate their differentiation. In particular, a novel biological system that models the transition from the pre-BI stage to the pre-BII subsequent stage, where B cell progenitors undergo growth arrest and differentiation, was used. The approach involves a pre-B cell line, B3, and an inducible version of the Ikaros transcription factor, Ikaros-ERt2. Ikaros factors act to down-regulate genes that drive proliferation and to simultaneously up-regulate the expression of genes that promote the differentiation of B cell progenitors. Hence, in the B3 system, before induction of Ikaros, cells proliferate and their gene expression pattern is similar to proliferating B cell progenitors in vivo. Following Ikaros induction, B3 cells undergo gene expression changes that resemble those that occur in vivo during the transition from cycling to resting pre-B cells, followed by a marked reduction in cellular proliferation and by G1 arrest. On this system the consortium has created a high-quality data collection consisting of a replicated time course using seven different 'omics platforms: RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, ChIP-seq, DNase-seq, Methyl-seq, proteomics and metabolomics, which is used to assess and to validate STATegra methods. The STATegra experimental design consists of a 6 point time course that captures the differentiation of B3 cells containing Ikaros-ERt2 upon Ikaros induction within a 24 hr period. The process was sampled at 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hrs respectively after Ikaros induction by Tamoxifen. As control, B3 cells transfected with an empty vector were treated and sampled in the same way as the inducible line. Eight different 'omic technologies were measured on this system: RNA-seq, miRNA-seq, DNase-seq, RRBS-seq, ChIP-seq, scRNA-seq, Proteomics and Metabolomics. Generally, three biological replicates were obtained per platform and were processed as independent batches. Metabolomics analysis was performed using 4 biological batches (7, 8, 9 and 10) and at times 0, 2, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hrs respectively. Each sample was analyzed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS).","Sample collection: Cells containing inducible Ikaros were generated by transducing mouse pre-B cell line B3 with mouse stem cell virus (MSCV) retroviral vectors encoding a fusion protein of haemagglutinin-tagged wild type Ikaros (HA-Ikaros) and the estrogen receptor hormone-binding domain (ERt2), followed by an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) and GFP. B3 cells containing inducible Ikaros (HA-Ikaros-ERt2-IRES-GFP) were plated at a density of 0.5 million cells\/ml in IMDM medium containing 10% FCS and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. 0.5 \u00b5M 4 hydroxy-tamoxifen was added to the cells 2 hrs before collection.","Extraction: B3 cells containing inducible Ikaros were plated at a density of 0.5 million cells\/ml in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin. Time point samples were collected after 5 mins centrifugation at 1200 rpm. Cell pellets were washed 2 times in PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Control vector-ERt2 B3 cells were plated at a density of 0.5 million cells\/ml in IMDM medium supplemented with 10% FCS and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin. Samples were collected after 5 mins centrifugation at 1200 rpm. Cell pellets were washed 2 times in PBS, frozen in liquid nitrogen and storaged at -80 \u00b0C. Four biological batches (9, 10, 11 and 12) were acquired. Tubes with cell pellets were taken out of the freezer and put on dry ice prior to the solid\/liquid extraction. Samples were extracted based on [1] with a small modification. Briefly, three consecutive extractions were performed with the same cell pellet and the liquid extracts were combined as the final extract. Only the first extraction solution contains the added internal standard which is labeled yeast extract obtained from Rheza Sharifi (Technical University Delft). The first and second extractions were performed using methanol (500 \u00b5l) and the third extraction with milliQ water (250 \u00b5l). The cell pellets were sonicated for 10 secs at 20% amplitude of the SONIX Ultrasonicator (750 kW) on ice. After this step, 40 \u00b5l of the first cell extract was aliquoted for the BCA based protein weight measurement into 1.5 ml tubes. 10% of the pooled liquid extract (125 \u00b5l) was aliquoted for the amine profiling platform. 70% of the pooled liquid extract was aliquoted (875 \u00b5l) for the GC-MS metabolite profiling platform. The rest was kept for CE-MS metabolite profiling platform (which is not added to this report). To generate the QC samples, B3 cells with control vector were grown and harvested as the samples. The extracts from thirteen cell pellets (each 1 x 10^7 live cells) were pooled to generate the QC samples for two platforms. QC samples do not fully represent the whole study as they were not treated with 5-OHT. Briefly, 500 \u00b5l of methanol and labeled yeast extract mixture was added onto the cell pellet at -80 \u00b0C. The cell pellet was sonicated for 10 secs at 20% amplitude of the SONIX Ultrasonicator (750 kW) on ice. The suspension was centrifugated for 10 mins at 15000 x g and 4 \u00b0C. Then the supernatant was collected in a 2ml tube. Another 500 \u00b5l of methanol solution was added onto the same cell pellet. The cell pellet was vortexed and they are centrifugated for 10 min at 15000 x g and 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was combined with the first one in 2 ml tube. The last extraction was performed with 250 \u00b5l of milliQ water and the supernatant was combined with the previous two supernatants. Aliquots were taken as mentioned above for each platform. These aliquots were dried using a SpeedVac (Labconco). Dried metabolite pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until further analysis. Ref: [1] Sellick CA, Hansen R, Stephens GM, Goodacre R, Dickson AJ.

Cell pellets were extracted with 13C-labeled yeast extract solution provided by Dr. Reza M. Seifar (TU Delft; see [1] for more details). The compounds detected in these extracts were used as internal standards for this platform. For this analysis 875 \u00b5l aliquot of liquid extract was collected and dried. The metabolite pellet went through a two-step derivatization procedure with oximation using methoxyamine hydrochloride (MeOX) as first reaction and trimethylsilylation using N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) as the second reaction. Finally, samples were centrifugated and the supernatant was transferred to autosampler vials and 1 \u00b5l of the sample was measured by GC-MS. Due to the limited stability of the silyl derivates, samples were injected a single time. An Agilent GC (7890A) coupled to Agilent Quadrupole-MS with EI source (Agilent MSD 5975C) was used. Separation was performed using a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 m x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent). LC-MS: The amine platform covers amino acids and biogenic amines employing an Accq-tag derivatization strategy adapted from the protocol supplied by Waters and described elsewhere [2]. Cell extracts were spiked with 13C-labeled yeast extract solution provided by Dr. Reza M. Seifar (TU Delft; see [1] for more details). The compounds detected in these extracts were used as internal standards for this platform. For this analysis a 125 \u00b5l aliquot of the extract was collected and dried. The residue was reconstituted in borate buffer (pH 8.5) with AQC reagent. After reaction, the vials were transferred to an autosampler tray and cooled to 10 \u00b0C until the injection. 1.0 \u00b5l of the reaction mixture was injected into the UPLC-MS\/MS system. An ACQUITY UPLC system with autosampler (Waters, Etten-Leur, The Netherlands) was coupled online with a Xevo Tandem quadrupole mass spectrometer (Waters) operated using QuanLynx data acquisition software (version 4.1; Waters).

TCP has longer half-life in soil and greater solubility in water than its parent compound, and cause wide contamination in environments. However, studies about the toxic effects of TCP are limited and outdate. In this study, 5 mg\/kg\/day, 50 mg\/kg\/day, and 150 mg\/kg\/day TCP were given to male mice through gavage for four weeks. As a result, the final body weights of TCP treated groups were significantly lower than control, and the relative organ weights of the liver and kidney were significantly higher than that of control. In addition, NMR-based metabolomics was used to investigate the toxic effects of TCP. It was found that a total of 39 serum metabolites were significantly changed in the TCP-treated groups, and these metabolites are related to hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. These results were also confirmed by histopathology, serum biochemical, and oxidative stress analysis. In addition, metabolic disturbances due to TCP exposure were also observed based on altered metabolites. As far as we know, these results are the first to show the metabolomic toxicity of TCP, which warrants further research.","Sample collection: Male mice (Mus musculus, ICR) were purchased from Qinglongshan Animal Breeding Center (Nanjing, China) and housed in polycarbonate cages with sawdust bedding in temperature (20\u201325 \u00b0C) and relative humidity (50\u201355%) rooms with a 12 h light\/dark cycle. The age of mice is five-week-old. Animals were provided standard chow and water ad libitum. After acclimatization for two weeks, animals were randomly assigned to control group and three TCP-treated groups (5 mice for each group and placed into a separate cage). For control group, corn oil (200 \u00b5l) was given to mice by gavage daily. For three TCP-treated groups, mice received a daily dose of TCP in corn oil (200 \u00b5l) at 5 mg\/kg bw (low dose group, L), 50 mg\/kg bw (mid dose group, M) and 150 mg\/kg bw (high dose group, H) for a period of 28 days to evaluate the chronic toxicity of TCP on mice. TCP (analytical grade) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The TCP exposure doses employed were chosen based on previously studies[1] and published toxicity data in ECOTOX database of EPA. After 28 days exposure, all mice were anesthetized with diethyl ether. The livers and kidneys were removed and frozen immediately. Blood samples were collected from ocular artery by removing the eyeball quickly. Serum was harvested by centrifuging at 3000 rpm for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C and stored at -80 \u00b0C.

The significantly changed metabolites between the control and treatment groups were identified based on the criteria that the FDR < 0.01 and the variable influence on projection (VIP) score > 1 (which contributed relative large to the PLS-DA). The z-scores of the altered metabolites were calculated with the following formula: z-score = (treatment metabolite abundance - control mean) \/ standard deviation of control[1]. In order to visualize the variation of metabolites between TCP-treated groups and control group, hierarchical clustering and heat map generation were performed based on the z-scores by using the R package pheatmap.

Quantitative metabolomics analysis can provide insights into metabolite dynamics for understanding community response to such changing environmental conditions. In this study, we quantified volatile organic acids, polar metabolites (amino acids, glycolytic and citric acid cycle intermediates, nucleobases, nucleosides, and sugars), wax esters, and polyhydroxyalkanoates, resulting in the identification of 104 metabolites and related molecules in thermal chlorophototrophic microbial mat cores collected over a diel cycle in Mushroom Spring, Yellowstone National Park. A limited number of predominant taxa inhabit this community and their functional potentials have been previously identified through metagenomics and metatranscriptomic analyses and in situ metabolisms, and metabolic interactions among these taxa have been hypothesized. Our metabolomics results confirmed the diel cycling of photorespiration (e.g., glycolate) and fermentation (e.g., acetate, propionate, and lactate) products, the carbon storage polymers polyhydroxyalkanoates, and dissolved gasses (e.g., H2 and CO2) in the waters overlying the mat, which were hypothesized to occur in major mat chlorophototrophic community members. In addition, we have formulated the following new hypotheses: (1) the morning hours are a time of biosynthesis of amino acids, DNA, and RNA; (2) photo-inhibited cells may also produce lactate via fermentation as an alternate metabolism; (3) glycolate and lactate are exchanged among Synechococcus and Roseiflexus spp.; and (4) fluctuations in many metabolite pools (e.g., waxesters) at different times of day result from species found at different depths within the mat responding to temporal differences in their niches.","Sample collection: For whole-mat (i.e., intracellular and extracellular metabolites combined) analyses of volatile organic acids, polar metabolites, wax esters, and PHAs, core samples were collected from a microbial mat in the effluent channel of Mushroom Spring in the Lower Geyser Basin (YNP, WY) where the temperature of the water in the sampling area varied from 58 to 62 \u00b0C during the diel cycle. A cork-borer with an 8 mm inner diameter was used to collect the same volume of mat sample, and a razor blade was used to separate the top 5 mm of each mat core such that the analyses were focused on the top green phototrophic layer and the red-orange under mat layers in the zone that contain most of the biological activity [1]. The samples were transferred to microcentrifuge tubes and immediately frozen in a Dewar containing liquid nitrogen. Mat samples were collected in triplicate at 14 time points between 13:30 h on September 21, 2012 and 11:00 h the following day. For analyses of extracellular metabolites, mat core samples were collected at 03:00, 09:00, 13:00, and 19:00 h (n = 6, each) during the same diel cycle. Once collected, three core samples from each time point were immediately frozen as described above for use as unrinsed controls, while the remaining three samples were transferred to 15 ml Falcon tubes containing 1 ml of spring water that had been filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter. Since the 68 \u00b0C source pool of Mushroom Spring is lined with mat, in order to avoid metabolites that might have diffused from the mat to overflowing water, we used water from the source pool (92 \u00b0C) of chemically similar Octopus Spring [2], which is well upstream of photosynthetic mats (maximum range of 72\u201374 \u00b0C). This water did not contain significant levels of any of the organic compounds detected in this study. The re-suspended mat cores were then quickly disrupted on site by vigorous shaking, and the biomass and rinse water were then immediately separated using a centrifuge (16,025 x g for 5 min). The supernatant was transferred to a clean microcentrifuge tube and the rinsed biomass and the rinse water samples were immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen. All samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until further processing. This process did not result in release of metabolites identified in analyses of biomass, suggesting that it did not cause leakage of constituents from intact cells.

PMID:12871232 ","Extraction: A single metabolite extraction protocol was used for the analysis of the various classes of metabolites described herein. Frozen mats were thawed at room temperature and 100 \u00b5l each of Nanopure\u2122 water and zirconia-silica beads (0.1 mm size; Biospec Products; Bartlesville, OK) were added, respectively, to the samples and vigorously vortexed for 2 min. This bead-beating process was repeated after the samples were maintained at room temperature for 5 min. A mixture of chloroform\/methanol (400 \u00b5l; 2:1, v\/v) spiked with 20 \u00b5g of 13C-labeled acetate (Sigma-Aldrich catalog number 282022-250) was added to each disrupted mat sample, and the mixtures were repeatedly vortexed to ensure thorough mixing. The samples were centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to separate aqueous and organic layers from precipitated proteins. For analysis of acetate and propionate, aliquots (50 \u00b5l) of the aqueous layer from each extract were transferred to glass vials equipped with glass inserts for direct GC-MS analysis without chemical derivatization. Because acetate and propionate are volatile molecules, all samples were immediately analyzed after extraction. For untargeted analysis of polar metabolites, aliquots (150 \u00b5l) of the remaining aqueous layer from each sample extract were transferred to glass vials and completely dried in vacuo. The dried extracts were stored at -20 \u00b0C until chemical derivatization. For analysis of wax esters, aliquots (200 \u00b5l) of the organic layer from each extract were analyzed directly using GC-MS without chemical derivatization.  For analysis of PHAs, the remaining organic layer from each extract was combined with the corresponding protein pellet, and the combined extract and pellet were completely dried in vacuo. The samples were hydrolyzed using a modification of an earlier method [1]. Briefly, the dried pellets were dissolved in methanol containing 15% H2SO4 (v\/v) and incubated at 100 \u00b0C for 15h. The resulting PHA monomers were extracted with chloroform and analyzed by GC-MS. Ref: [1] Lageveen R. G., Huisman G. W., Preusting H., Ketelaar P., Eggink G., Witholt B. (1988).

PMID:16347790 ","Chromatography: An Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled with a single quadrupole 5975C mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) was used for all analyses. Samples were analyzed in duplicate by optimized GC-MS methods, which varied according to the classes of molecular targets as described below. Acetate and propionate were quantified in a targeted fashion using 13C-labeled acetate as an internal standard. Briefly, mixtures of unlabeled acetate and proprionate at different concentrations were combined with constant amounts of 13C-labeled acetate in order to construct calibration curves. 13C-labeled acetate was then spiked into microbial mat lysates prior to extraction of metabolites, and the measured ratios of unlabeled acetate and propionate to labeled internal standard were used to accurately quantify the target molecules. A polar column (HP-FFAP; 30 m x 0.250 mm x 0.250 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara) was used. The temperature of the GC inlet was maintained at 200 \u00b0C, and samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected in splitless mode with a helium gas flow rate of 1.0 ml\/min. A temperature gradient from 40 to 200 \u00b0C over 20 min was used, and data were collected over the mass range 20\u2013300 m\/z. To reduce any carry over arising from the direct injection of the aqueous layers (a mixture of methanol and water) from the metabolite extraction procedure, pure methanol blanks were analyzed between each sample. For untargeted analysis of polar metabolites, extracted metabolites in the dried aqueous layers were chemically derivatized to trimethylsilyl esters as previously described [1]. Metabolite extracts were dried in vacuo again to remove any residual moisture. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, methoxyamine (20 \u00b5l of a 30 mg\/ml stock in pyridine) was added to each sample, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 90 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (80 \u00b5l) was added to each vial, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 30 min. The samples were allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed on the same day. An HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies) was used for untargeted analyses. Samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected in splitless mode, and the helium gas flow rate was determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was held at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 \u00b0C. Data were collected over the mass range 50\u2013550m\/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8\u2013C28) was analyzed together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis. For analysis of wax esters, aliquots of the organic layer from the metabolite extracts were directly injected into the GC-MS. For analysis of PHA monomers, the acid-hydrolyzed samples were analyzed. Wax esters and PHA monomers were chromatographically separated using the same HP-5MS column as described above. Samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected in splitless mode. The GC oven was held at 60 \u00b0C for 5 (wax esters) or 10 (PHA monomers) min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 1 (PHA monomers) or 5 (wax esters) min hold at 325 \u00b0C. The helium gas flow rate was 1.0 ml\/min and the injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis.

PMID:19358599 ","Metabolite id: The relative amounts of acetate and propionate in the mat samples were quantified by isotope dilution mass spectrometry. Standard curves for acetate and propionate were constructed as described above, and the integrated peak areas of acetate, propionate, and 13C-acetate in mat samples were determined using the corresponding extracted ion chromatograms (EICs; acetate, m\/z 60; propionate, m\/z 74; and 13C-acetate, m\/z 62). The peak areas of endogenous acetate and propionate were divided by that of 13C-acetate to obtain ratios of unlabeled\/labeled target molecules. Retention indices (RI) of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAME standard mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution. Metabolites were then identified by matching GC-MS features (characterized by measured retention indices and mass spectra) to an augmented version of the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library [1], which contains spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites. All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08GC-MS library was also used to cross-validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library. A heat-map analysis was also carried out after z-score transformation of the obtained signal intensities and with K-means clustering (K = 5, Distance metric: Euclidean) using DanteR [2]. For wax ester analysis, the 10 most abundant species from > 30 detected and quantified in the microbial mat samples were selected based on a previous report [3] and their abundances were determined by the EIC method described above. For PHA analysis, the monomers were also quantified using the EIC method described above.

The dried extract was reconstituted with 100 \u03bcl of methanol and isopropanol (1:1) and 10 \u03bcl of this sample solution was injected LC-MS system for each run. Lipid standards were prepared in same solvent with concentration of 100 ng\/ml each. All lipid standards used for validation of annotations were purchased from Sigma Chemicals (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO) and Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, LA, USA). The LC- MS grade buffers and other reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical. All mass spectrometry grade solvents and MiliQ grade water was used throughout the analysis.","Chromatography: The separation of lipids was carried out on Agilent 1260 liquid chromatography (LC) system with Ascentis\u00ae Express C18 column (100 x 2.1 mm; 2.7 \u00b5M) and detected with high resolution mass spectrometry (Q Exactive Plus MS, Thermo Scientific). LC was run with flow rate of 0.25 ml\/min with solvent A consisted of acetonitrile\u2212water (6:4) and solvent B of isopropyl alcohol\u2212acetonitrile (9:1), which were buffered with either 10 mM ammonium formate and 0.1% formic acid (buffer 1) or 10 mM ammonium acetate (buffer 2).","Mass spec: Three LC-MS\/MS methods were used; Positive: ESI positive mode using buffer 1 Negative 1: ESI negative mode method using buffer 1 Negative 2: ESI negative mode method used buffer 2 MS parameters (Tune, Thermo Scientific) were set as: spray voltage of 4 kV, sheath gas 30 and auxiliary gas 10 units, S-Lens 65 eV, capillary temperature 280 \u00b0C and vaporisation temperature of auxiliary gas was 280 \u00b0C. Data was acquired in full scan mode in mass range of 150-900 m\/z (resolving power R=70000) and data dependent tandem mass spectra (MS\/MS) were obtained for all precursors from an inclusion list (resolving power R=35000). Tandem mass spectra (MS\/MS) were acquired using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) with normalized collision energies of 10, 20 and 30 units at the mass. The inclusion list was composed of all annotations provided from imaging MS analysis and detected in all three serial sections (s1, s2, s3 at the Bregma 1.42) for either of two animals. We considered adducts relevant for LC- MS (+H, +NH4, +Na for the Positive method; -H, -H+HCOOH for the Negative methods).","Data transformation: Centroiding (vendor provided)","Metabolite id: LC-MS\/MS validation of lipid annotations was performed differently for annotations when lipid standards are available and for other annotations. When lipid standards were available, LC-MS\/MS information in particular the LC retention time (RT), MS and MS\/MS (MS2) was used to compare the data from a standard with the data from a sample (both acquired using exactly the same LC-MS method and precursor selection range). First, extracted ion chromatograms (XICs) were evaluated for all possible adducts to confirm the presence of the ion of the sum formula obtained from imaging data. As for the tolerance value for XICs: for data with standards we used the 5 ppm; for data with no standards we selected the best fitting tolerance value from 2, 3, and 5 ppm. We considered possible adducts for each metabolite (+H, +Na, +NH4 for the \u2018Positive\u2019 method; -H, +FA-H for the \u2018Negative\u2019 methods, FA stands for the formic acid) and selected the best matching adduct as follows. The precursor delta m\/z was calculated for the sample both in MS1 and MS\/MS data. The matching MS\/MS spectrum was searched within the elution profile and manually interpreted for fragments corresponding to head-group and fatty acid side chains. Only precursor and fragments with accuracy <6 ppm were considered for structural interpretation to identify possible lipid species. The lipid class was confirmed by the presence of head-group fragment or its neutral loss (e.g. MS\/MS fragment with m\/z 184.0735 corresponds to the phosphocholine head-group). Since lipids from the classes of phosphatidylcholines (PC) and sphingomyelins (SM) have the same head-group (m\/z 184.0735), given a sum formula, we searched in HMDB and SwissLipids to rule out a possibility of the sum formula to correspond to a lipid from another class other than annotated by our framework. Further to confirm the fatty acid side chains, the \u2018Negative\u2019 LC-MS methods were used (e.g. fatty acid fragments for phosphocholines were obtained after fragmentation of formate ion precursors using the \u2018Negative\u2019 LC-MS method). The collision energy was selected as best representing the precursor and the expected fragments. When standards were available, the RT, precursor m\/z and MS\/MS fragments corresponding to head-groups and fatty acid chains from the sample were matched with spectra from the corresponding standard. When standards were not available the fragments were manually interpreted. Finally, structural annotation of the matching peaks in the MS\/MS spectra was performed with the help of the HighChem MassFrontier software (Thermo Scientific). The MS, MS\/MS and RT (for standards) data is presented in Supplementary Notes 1, 2 and summarized in Table S5 of the associated paper."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS378","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS378","title":"FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry imaging MS (LC-MS assay)","date":"2016-12-05","timestamp":1480896000,"submitter":["Andrew Palmer","Prasad Phapale","Theodore Alexandrov"],"publications":[{"title":"FDR-controlled metabolite annotation for high-resolution imaging mass spectrometry.","doi":"10.1038\/nmeth.4072","pubmed":"PMID:27842059"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"QExactive Plus","organism":"Mus musculus","organism_parts":"brain","metabolites":["Galactosylceramide(d18:1\/24:1)","Glycerophosphocholine","LysoPC(16:0)","PA(18:1\/18:1)","PC(16:0_18:0)","PC(16:0\/16:0)","PC(16:0\/18:1)","PC(16:0\/18:2)","PC(18:1\/18:1)","PC(18:2\/18:2)","PE(18:0_22:6)","PE(18:0\/18:0)","PE(P-18:1_20:4)","phosphatidylserine(18:0\/18:1)","PS(18:0\/18:1)","SM(d34:1)","SM(d36:1)"]}},"MTBLS1":{"description":["Type 2 diabetes mellitus is the result of a combination of impaired insulin secretion with reduced insulin sensitivity of target tissues.

In a comprehensive non-targeted metabolite profiling study by means of UPLC\/ESI-QTOFMS and GC\/EI-QMS we analyzed Arabidopsis thaliana\u2019s roots, root exudates, and leaves of inoculated and non-inoculated plants and identified further biomarkers.

For instance, identification of PC 16:0-18:1 requires corresponding signals from both the 16:0 (PIS of m\/z 255.2) and the 18:1 (PIS of m\/z 281.2) scans. MRM data was processed in MultiQuant(TM). The selected lipid characteristic ions and their parent masses in conjunction with retention time were used for the identification of the endogenous species. The identified lipids were quantified by normalizing against their respective internal standard and matrix type, and presented accordingly in \u00b5M. For identification of differentially abundant lipids, outlier samples with a total summed lipid concentration below (above) the first (third) quartil (+) 1.5 x the interquartile range were excluded. For the identification of differentially abundant lipids between the groups, only lipid species that were present\/quantified in at least 50% of the samples of each group were included. The data was log-transformed and linear models were fitted for the following group contrasts: CS vs. NS, CS vs. FS, FS vs. NS, COPD vs. NS, COPD vs. FS, and COPD vs. CS. In the final models, gender, age, and BMI were included as covariates. P-values from a moderated t-statistic were calculated with the empirical Bayes approach and the Benjamini Hochberg FDR method wass used to correct for multiple testing effects."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS358","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS358","title":"Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Biomarker Identification Study: Serum Lipidomics.","date":"2017-02-20","timestamp":1487548800,"submitter":["Sam Ansari","Bjoern Titz","Terhi Vihervaara"],"publications":[{"title":"Alterations in Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Eicosanoids in Patients with Mild to Moderate Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).","doi":"","pubmed":"PMID:27657052"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"QTRAP 6500 (Applied Biosystems)","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"blood serum","metabolites":["TAG(48:0)","TAG(48:1)","TAG(48:2)","TAG(49:1)","TAG(50:1)","TAG(50:2)","TAG(50:3)","TAG(50:4)","TAG(51:1)","TAG(51:2)","TAG(52:1)","TAG(52:2)","TAG(52:3)","TAG(52:4)","TAG(52:5)","TAG(53:2)","TAG(53:3)","TAG(54:2)","TAG(54:3)","TAG(54:4)","TAG(54:5)","TAG(54:6)","TAG(56:6)","11,12-DHET","11-HETE","12-HEPE","12-HETE","13-HODE","14,15-DHET","15-HETE","15-HETrE","5,6-DHET","5-HEPE","5-HETrE","8-HETE","9-HODE","AA","DHA","EPA","TXB2","Cer(d18:0\/16:0)","Cer(d18:0\/18:0)","Cer(d18:0\/20:0)","Cer(d18:0\/22:0)","Cer(d18:0\/24:0)","Cer(d18:0\/24:1)","Cer(d18:1\/16:0)","Cer(d18:1\/18:0)","Cer(d18:1\/18:1)","Cer(d18:1\/20:0)","Cer(d18:1\/22:0)","Cer(d18:1\/22:1)","Cer(d18:1\/23:0)","Cer(d18:1\/24:0)","Cer(d18:1\/24:1)","Cer(d18:1\/26:0)","Cer(d18:1\/26:1)","Gb3(d18:1\/16:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/18:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/20:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/22:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/22:1)","Gb3(d18:1\/23:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/24:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/24:1)","Gb3(d18:1\/26:0)","Gb3(d18:1\/26:1)","GlcCer(d18:1\/16:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/16:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/18:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/18:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/20:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/20:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/22:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/22:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/22:1)","GalCer(d18:1\/22:1)","GlcCer(d18:1\/23:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/23:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/24:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/24:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/24:1)","GalCer(d18:1\/24:1)","GlcCer(d18:1\/26:0)","GalCer(d18:1\/26:0)","GlcCer(d18:1\/26:1)","GalCer(d18:1\/26:1)","LacCer(d18:1\/16:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/18:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/20:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/22:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/23:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/24:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/24:1)","LacCer(d18:1\/26:0)","LacCer(d18:1\/26:1)"]}},"MTBLS315":{"description":["Background: Non-malaria febrile illnesses such as bacterial bloodstream infections (BSI) are a leading cause of disease and mortality in the tropics. However, there are no reliable, simple diagnostic tests for identifying BSI or other severe non-malaria febrile illnesses. We hypothesized that different infectious agents responsible for severe febrile illness would impact on the host metabololome in different ways, and investigated the potential of plasma metabolites for diagnosis of non-malaria febrile illness. <\/p> Methodology: We conducted a comprehensive mass-spectrometry based metabolomics analysis of the plasma of 61 children with severe febrile illness from a malaria-endemic rural African setting. Metabolite features characteristic for non-malaria febrile illness, BSI, severe anemia and poor clinical outcome were identified by receiver operating curve analysis. <\/p> Principal Findings: The plasma metabolome profile of malaria and non-malaria patients revealed fundamental differences in host response, including a differential activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. A simple corticosteroid signature was a good classifier of severe malaria and non-malaria febrile patients (AUC 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.93). Patients with BSI were characterized by upregulated plasma bile metabolites; a signature of two bile metabolites was estimated to have a sensitivity of 98.1% (95% CI: 80.2-100) and a specificity of 82.9% (95% CI: 54.7-99.9) to detect BSI in children younger than 5 years. This BSI signature demonstrates that host metabolites can have a superior diagnostic sensitivity compared to pathogen-detecting tests to identify infections characterized by low pathogen load such as BSI. <\/p> Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential use of plasma metabolites to identify causality in children with severe febrile illness in malaria-endemic settings.","Sample collection: Patients were recruited at the district hospital Centre M\u00e9dical avec Antenne Chirurgicale Saint Camille in malaria-endemic Nanoro, Burkina Faso. Admitted children < 15 years of age presenting with axillary temperature = 38 \u00b0C, or clinical signs of severe illness were enrolled. Medical history, physical examination and outcome of febrile episode were registered on a standardized form. At time of hospital admission, venous whole blood for blood culture, malaria diagnosis, full blood count, glucose measurements, plasma metabolome analysis, and 16S rRNA deep sequencing were collected from all participants by trained study nurses. Samples were submitted within 15 min after collection to the lab facility of the Clinical Research Unit of Nanoro (CRUN), which is located on the compound of the district hospital St. Camille. 1-3 ml venous blood was collected into a pediatric blood culture bottle (BD BACTEC Preds Plus TM\/F, Becton Dickinson and Company, USA). Blood culture bottles were incubated in a BACTEC 9050 instrument (Becton Dickinson) for a total of 5 days. If flagged for growth they were Gram stained, subcultured on EMB agar and 5% Sheep Blood agar (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) and incubated at 35-37 \u00b0C for 24 h in atmospheric conditions and at 5% CO2 respectively. Isolates were identified to the species level by standard biochemical methods. Thick and thin blood films were stained with 3% Giemsa solution, and examined for presence of Plasmodium species according to standard procedures by at least 2 experienced microscopists. Results were expressed as asexual parasites per \u00b5l using the patient\u2019s white blood cell count. The malaria rapid diagnostic test (RDT) recommended by the national malaria control program, SD Bioline Pf (Standard Diagnostics, Korea) detecting P. falciparum-specific histidine-rich protein-2 (HRP-2), was performed on EDTA blood samples according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Decision for additional infectious disease testing (e.g. HIV) was left to the discretion of attending health staff; only 1 study participant was identified as HIV-positive. Full blood counts were assessed using Sysmex XS1000i (Sysmex Corporation, Japan). Full blood was collected on NaF tubes for glucose level measurement on Flexor Junior (Vital Scientific, Netherlands). For metabolomics analysis, one 1 ml EDTA blood sample was centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C for plasma separation. The plasma fraction was divided in 100 \u00b5l aliquots and immediately frozen at -80 \u00b0C. Plasma aliquots were stored within 2 h of sample collection, plasma processing times were kept in the study log book. Plasma samples were shipped on dry ice with temperature-control to the Institute of Tropical Medicine Antwerp for metabolite extraction. Leftover EDTA blood samples (200-1000 \u00b5l) were kept at -80 \u00b0C at CRUN and utilized for additional molecular diagnosis of BSI. PCR products resulting from amplification of the V3-V4 regions of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene were deep sequenced on the Illumnia MiSeq platform (Illumina, USA). The sequencing reads underwent a quality filtering process using mothur. Paired reads were joined into single contigs and any contigs with ambiguous bases or a length longer than the 2 individual read lengths, were removed. Taxonomy was assigned using GAST and the associated full length 16S SILVA reference database (retrieved 13\/02\/15). Taxonomy assignments found within any negative control samples were labeled as potential contaminants and removed from all samples. Samples were only considered positive if a taxonomy assignment up to species level of a clinically significant organism could be reproduced in 2 repeated sequencing experiments.","Extraction: GC-MS: For GC-MS, a 50 \u00b5l plasma aliquot was thawed on ice followed by addition of 100 \u00b5l ultrapure methanol. An additional 100 \u00b5l internal standard solution (0.2 mg\/ml succinic-d4 acid, benzoic d5 acid, glycine-d5, lysine-d4 from Cambridge Isotope laboratories, UK) was added. The resulting mixture was vortex mixed and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min. Following centrifugation, 125 \u00b5l of the clean supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for 16 hrs. C18-UHPLC-MS: For C18-UHPLC-MS, a 50 \u00b5l plasma aliquot was thawed on ice followed by addition of 100 \u00b5l ultrapure methanol. The resulting mixture was vortex mixed and centrifuged at 13,500 rpm for 15 min. Following centrifugation, 125 \u00b5l of the clean supernatant was transferred to a clean tube and dried in a centrifugal vacuum evaporator for 16 hrs. C8-LC-MS: Samples for lipid analysis on C8-LC-MS positive mode were prepared with a butanol\/methanol extraction. The extraction solvent was prepared by mixing equal amounts of pure butanol and methanol, 10 mM ammonium formate, 0.1% butylated hydroxytoluene and 2.5 \u00b5M internal standard solution including D31PE(34:1), D31PS(34:1) and D31PI(34:1) (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., USA ). A 10 \u00b5l plasma aliquot was thawed on ice and mixed with 90 \u00b5l of the extraction solvent. The mixture was vortexed for 30 sec and sonicated for 30 min, all the while ensuring that temperature was maintained at room temperature (20 \u00b0C). The resulting mix was centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min at 0 \u00b0C, and 50 \u00b5l of the supernatant was directly transferred to 0.2 ml micro-inserts of LC-MS glass vials with Teflon insert caps.","Chromatography: GC-MS: Samples for GC-MS analysis were prepared applying a two-stage chemical derivatisation procedure (oximation followed by trimethylsilylation) and followed by analysis applying an electron inonisation GC-TOF-MS system (Agilent 6890N GC coupled to a LECO Pegasus III mass spectrometer). 5 QC samples were analysed at the start of each analytical batch to condition the analytical system and a QC sample was analysed every 5th injection. The study samples were analysed in 2 analytical experimental batches. C18-UHPLC-MS: For C18-UHPLC-MS, samples were analysed as described by [1]. Briefly, the samples were reconstituted in 50 \u00b5l water and analysed applying C18-UHPLC-Orbitrap MS (Thermo Accela UHPLC coupled to a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer) over a 25 min runtime. 10 QC samples were analysed at the start of an analytical batch to condition the analytical system and a QC sample was analysed every 5th injection. The study samples were analysed in 1 analytical batch. C8-LC-MS: For C8-LC-MS, the samples were analysed as described earlier by [2]. Briefly the samples were analysed on a C8-LC-QTOF (Agilent 1290 LC coupled to an Agilent QTOF 6550 mass spectrometer) with a 30 min runtime. 10 solvent samples were analysed at the start of the analytical batch to condition the system and a QC sample was analysed every 4th injection. All study samples were analysed in 1 analytical batch. Samples were analysed in randomized order in each experiment. Ref: [1] Dunn WB, Broadhurst D, Begley P, et al.

PMID:18841877 ","Mass spec: GC-MS: For GC-MS, compounds were detected by a LECO Pegasus III mass spectrometer. C18-UHPLC-MS: For C18-UHPLC-MS, compounds were detected from m\/z 100-1000 using a Thermo LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer in positive and negative mode. C8-LC-MS: For C8-LS-MS, compounds wered detected from m\/z 100-1000 using a Agilent QTOF mass spectrometer in positive mode.","Data transformation: GC-MS: The two batches of raw GC-ToF-MS data files were peak picked and deconvolved using an internal deconvolution algorithm within the ChromaTof 2.1 software (Leco). This was applied stipulating an increasing peak width of 1.5 s (at 400 s) expanding to 1.8 s (at 800 s), a baseline cut-off at 0.5 and aligning to an internal retention index (decane, dodecane, pentadecane and nonadecane). In order to account for instrumental drift, an in-house LOESS correction curve was splined through each QC data point and each analytical point aligned accordingly. C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS: The LC-MS raw data files were converted into the mzXML format by msConvert. Further processing was handled by a flexible data processing pipeline implemented in R called mzMatch.R which includes XCMS-based mass chromatogram extraction and retention time alignment, peak matching, noise removal, contaminant removal based on extraction and solvent blanks, implementation dilution trend correlation filter to further remove non-informative peaks, correction signal drift over time based on fitting a LOESS function on the data of the QC samples, and peak derivative removal (isotopes, adducts, dimers and fragments) based on correlation analysis on both peak shape and intensity pattern. GC-MS, C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS: Metabolite peaks were considered to be detected reproducibly when they were detected in all QC samples and when the quantitative variation of the signal intensity across all the QC samples was less than 15% relative standard deviation (RSD) for the LC-MS platforms (samples analyzed in 1 analytical batch) and less than 20% RSD for GC-MS (samples analysed in 2 analytical batches). All peaks that did not fulfill these criteria were removed. Non-informative peaks that would not yield interesting biomarkers were also removed from the dataset and included: (i) peaks with signal intensity close to the limit of detection, (ii) peaks detected in less than 3 out of the 61 study samples, (iii) peaks that are near-constant in all included patient samples (RSD <15%). The final peak set obtained for each LC-MS platform was visually inspected to ensure that all included peaks corresponded to good-quality mass- chromatograms. Missing values in the data-matrix obtained per analytical platform were replaced with half the minimum value of the entire matrix of that analytical batch.","Metabolite id: GC-MS: After deconvolution of the GC-MS data, metabolite identification was performed initially against an in-house metabolite reference database of over 1500 internal standards (generally linked to primary metabolism) and then subsequently against putative mass spectral fragmentation patterns within the NIST 8.0 spectral database (containing mass spectra from over 800,000 different compounds). C18-UHPLC-MS and C8-LC-MS: The selected LC-MS peaks were putatively identified by matching the masses (mass accuracy < 5 ppm) progressively to those from metabolite-specific databases. In a first round of identification, we used the Human Metabolome Database, KEGG, and a contaminant database. Only the remaining unidentified peaks went through a second round of matching to LIPIDMAPS and METLIN spectral database.  Statistical analysis: The final metabolite features (i.e., peaks that could be identified to one of the four levels designated by the Metabolomics Standards Initiative) of all three analytical platforms were merged into 1 data-matrix that was checked in R for outlying samples using standard chemometric tools including principal component analysis and Mahalanobis distance. No outliers were detected and all samples were included in subsequent statistical analysis. All statistical analyses were also performed using the R software environment which comprises a selection of packages suitable for the implemented statistical methods: multivariate analysis (partial-least-squares (PLS) regression), receiver-operating curve (ROC) analysis, correlation analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis, biomarker validation and Bayesian latent class

conditions and duration have a considerable influence on wine quality. Optimum temperature and humidity conditions may improve wine quality through ageing, while incorrect or excessively long storage leads to negative results. In order to evaluate the global effects of storage on red wine composition, 20 Sangiovese wines were stored in two different conditions (cellar or house) for a period of 2 years and analysed every 6 months. Untargeted LC-MS analysis showed various putative markers for the type and length of conservation (i.e. pigments, flavanols, pantothenic acid etc.), while targeted LC-MS confirmed and expanded these results within specific metabolic groups. The results of multivariate analysis showed that wines stored in the cellar changed little even after 2 years of storage, while wines stored in typical domestic conditions (house) developed approximately four times faster, reaching after just 6 months a composition similar to wines stored in the cellar for 2 years. The formation of several monosulfonated flavanols during the domestic ageing provided the first evidence in wine of a reaction between wine tannins - both catechins and proanthocyanidins - and the exogenous antioxidant bisulfite. Moreover, ageing under domestic conditions appeared to induce an accelerated decrease of wine pigments, while specifically promoting the formation of the pinotin A-like pigments.","Sample collection: Grape sampling and winemaking: During 2009, twenty Vitis vinifera L. cv. Sangiovese grape samples from different areas of Montalcino (Tuscany, Italy) were collected, in order to cover the whole Brunello di Montalcino production area. A total of c. 80 kg of grapes was sampled from each selected vineyard. The grapes from each zone were vinified separately at the experimental winery of the Edmund Mach Foundation and after malolactic fermentation (March 2010) the wines were filtered and bottled, using a manual bottling machine with N2 as auxiliary gas, in 375 ml dark glass bottles (approx. 20 bottles for each wine) closed with natural monostick cork stoppers. Storage: After the bottling date, which was considered as time zero in the experimental design, two bottles of each wine were stored at 4 \u00b0C (references). The remaining bottles were divided into two lots and stored in two different conditions: (i) one set was stored in conditions mimicking typical domestic wine conservation, in a dark room with a relatively high temperature, with temperature controls being adjusted to human well-being (20\u201327 \u00b0C range, oscillating with the seasons) and no control of humidity ('house'); (ii) the other set was stored in the wine cellars of the Edmund Mach Foundation winery, where temperature (15\u201317 \u00b0C) and humidity (approx. 70%) were strictly controlled, being stable and ideal for red wine conservation ('cellar'). Every 6 months four bottles of each wine (two from the 'house' and two from the 'cellar' storage conditions) were sampled and brought to a temperature of 4 \u00b0C. The final storage time was 24 months from time zero and all the samples were analysed together at the end of the experiment.","Extraction: The UPLC-QTOF MS untargeted analyses were preformed within two months after the end of the experimental design and during this period wines were maintained at 4 \u00b0C so to block or slow down all possible reactions. Wines were uncorked under nitrogen atmosphere and an aliquot was transferred in a 15 ml amber vial (filled to its capacity). Then, always under nitrogen atmosphere, 3 quality control (QC) pool samples were prepared: (i) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each wine (QC), (ii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each House conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCH) and, (iii) one pool sample by using 0.5 ml of each Cellar conservation final point (24 months) wine (QCC). For the dilution test, the QC sample was diluted 1:1 and 1:2 with Milli-Q water. Following the dilution experiment results, 1 ml of each wine was diluted with 1 ml Milli-Q water (1:1 dilution) and then 20 \u00b5l of the internal standard mix was added. Finally every sample\/QC was filtrated with 0.2 \u00b5m PTFE filters into a 2 ml autosampler amber vial (MS certificated) prior the LC\/MS analysis. The internal standard mix was 10 mg 3-indol proprionic acid and 17 mg 2,6-dihydroxy benzoic acid in 10 ml of MeOH:OH (1:1). For the blank the same procedure was followed but instead of wine 1 ml of Milli-Q water was used. The standard mix (STDMIX) was a mixture of trans-piceid (20 ppm), caffeic acid (50 ppm), catechin (5 ppm), malvidin 3-glucoside (5 ppm), quercetin 3-rutinoside (6 ppm), adenosine 2-monophosphate (45 ppm), malic acid (48 ppm), nicotinic acid (46 ppm), phenylalanine (42 ppm), and glucose (45 ppm) in MeOH:H2O (70:30).","Chromatography: A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. The UPLC conditions were developed based in an in house previous published method [1][2] and small changes were made in order to have a shorter chromatographic run and smaller back pressures. All samples were analysed on a reversed phase (RP) ACQUITY UPLC 1.8 \u00b5m 2.1 x 150 mm HSS T3 column (Waters) protected with an Acquity UPLC HSS T3 1.8 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 5 mm precolumn (Waters), at 40 \u00b0C and under a mobile phase flow rate of 0.28 ml\/min. Water was used as weak eluting solvent (A) and methanol as strong elution solvent (B); formic acid 0.1% v\/v was used as additive in both eluents. The multistep linear gradient used was as follows: 0-1 min, 100% A isocratic; 1-3 min, 100-90% A linear; 3-18 min, 90-60% A linear; 18-21 min, 60-0% A linear; 21-25.5 min, 0% A isocratic; 25.5-25.6 min, 0-100% A linear; 25.6-28 min 100% isocratic. Injection volume was 10 \u00b5l, unless otherwise stated, and the samples were kept at 4 \u00baC throughout the analysis. Ref: [1] Arapitsas, P., Perenzoni, D., Nicolini, G., & Mattivi, F. (2012).

","Mass spec: A Waters Acquity UPLC coupled via an electrospray ionization (ESI) interface to a Synapt HDMS QTOF MS (Waters, Manchester, UK) operating in W-mode and controlled by MassLynx 4.1 was used. Mass spectrometric data were collected by different runs in positive and negative ESI mode over a mass range of 50 to 2000 amu with scan duration of 0.3 s in centroid mode. The transfer collision energy and trap collision energy were set at 6 V and 4 V. The source parameters were set as follows: capillary 3 kV for positive scan and 2.5 kV for negative scan, sampling cone 25 V, extraction cone 3V, source temperature 150 \u00baC, desolvation temperature 500 \u00baC, desolvation gas flow 1000 l\/h and nebulizer gas 50 l\/h. External calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch of analysis by direct infusion of a sodium formate solution (10% formic acid\/0.1 M NaOH\/Acetonitrile at a ratio of 1\/1\/8) by controlling the mass accuracy from 40 to 2000 m\/z (less than 5 ppm) and mass resolution (over 14000 FWHM). LockMass calibration was applied using a solution of leucine enkephaline (0.5 mg\/l, m\/z 556.2771 for positive and 554.2620 for negative ion mode) at 0.1 ml\/min.","Data transformation: For the quality control of the analysis and the number of features determination the raw data was converted to CDF (Waters Databridge) format and then processed using XCMS for feature extraction, grouping and alignment. For peak picking, the matched Filter algorithm was used with a peak width estimate of 20 s. The signal to noise parameter was set to S\/N = 4. Data extraction parameters were selected on the basis of the characteristics of chromatographic and mass spectrometric performance. The Peak Table output of XCMS was used for the statistical analysis by the software EZInfo SIMCA-P version 12.0.0 (Umetrics, Umea, Sweden) under Pareto normalization. The PCA plots of EZInfo SIMCA-P were used for the quality control of the data sets by checking the distribution of the QC injections. Orthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) were used to find features\/tentative markers contributing to groups\/conditions discriminations, based on the t-test with Mann-Whitney U-test and the S-plot of the SIMCA-P software.","Metabolite id: Peak annotation was performed manually by comparing retention times and mass spectra (mass difference less than 10 ppm and two ions) to those of the standard, when available. Tentative identification of the chromatographic peaks, without a standard, was made by using spectral features (mass difference less than 10 ppm of theoretical value at least one indicative fragment and the isotopic pattern), and literature information about chromatographic properties and mass spectra records from external database like HMDB, Kegg and MassBank and an internal database for the wine metabolome based in bibliography. Peak integration of all annotated compounds, internal standards and tentative markers was performed using the TargetLynx tool of MassLynx Waters Software. These integrated data were also used for quality control of the analysis by evaluating the variability of specific metabolites.","Data analysis: Dilution test: In order to find the optimum dilution, 10 injections of each QC dilution were carried out, starting with the most diluted QC sample. Between each dilution set, a blank sample was injected. The undiluted wine was also injected, after filtration, in both 5 and 10 lL injection volumes. MS QT of stability test: 60 injections of the optimum diluted QC were analysed, with one blank sample injection every 10 QC injections. Final point experiment: This experiment included 40 wines (20 house + 20 cellar) of the final point (24 months), QCH, QCC, blank and STDMIX. The in-batch order of all samples analysed in this study was randomized by using the http:\/\/www.random.org\/sequences\/ site. This sample set was analyzed both in ESI + and ESI- mode. In the beginning of every batch first one blank, then one STDMIX and after four QCs (2 QCH and 2 QCC) were injected. After this system equilibration two QC (one QCH and one QCC) was injected every six samples. The order of the two QCs were inverted every six samples. Finally in the end of every batch one blank and one standard mix were injected. Time series experiment: For this sample set, five out of the twenty wines were randomly selected and their reference (time zero), 6, 12, 18 and 24 storage month samples of both \u201chouse\u201d and \u201ccellar\u201d conditions were included.

Energy metabolism and oxidative stress have been recent focal points of ME\/CFS research and in this study we were able to elucidate metabolic pathways that were indicative of their dysfunction. Blood and urine samples were collected from 34 females with ME\/CFS (34.9 \u00b1 1.8 SE years old) and 25 non-ME\/CFS female participants (33.0 \u00b1 1.6 SE years old). All samples underwent metabolic profiling via 1D 1H Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and quantitated metabolites were assessed for significance. Blood glucose was elevated while blood lactate, urine pyruvate, and urine alanine were reduced indicating an inhibition of glycolysis that may potentially reduce the provision of adequate acetyl-CoA for the citric acid cycle. We propose that amino acids are being increasingly used to provide an adequate carbohydrate source for the citric acid cycle. We suggest that this is via glutamate forming 2-oxoglutarate through an enzyme that deaminates it and subsequently elevates blood aspartate. Dysfunctional energy metabolism appears to have impacted creatinine and its elevation in urine suggests that it may be used as an alternative for anaerobic ATP production within muscle. A decrease in blood hypoxanthine and an increase in urine allantoin further suggest the elevation of reactive oxygen species in ME\/CFS patients. These findings bring new information to the research of energy metabolism, chronic immune activation and oxidative stress issues within ME\/CFS.","Sample collection: Forty-six patients with Myalgic encephalomye litis\/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME\/CFS) and twenty-six non-ME\/CFS control subjects were recruited in total. Prior to statistical analysis we removed all males and any females that were above 60 years of age, which reduced the cohort to 34 females with ME\/CFS (34.9 \u00b1 1.8 SE years old) and 25 non-ME\/CFS female participants (33.0 \u00b1 1.6 SE years old). This was done to account for age and sex related variables across the cohort. The ME\/CFS group comprised patients that are currently symptomatic and diagnosed as having ME\/CFS in accordance to the Canadian guidelines [1] and cared by one clinician. Diagnosis of ME\/CFS was made on the nature of the clinical history, in association with the Canadian criteria, having excluded other illnesses. The same clinician also verified that subjects within the non-ME\/CFS cohort were not suffering from ME\/CFS or any other illness. All subjects were asked to list their current medications and oral supplements. None of the subjects were related to one another nor were they ever living together and none of the subjects were obese or nicotine dependent. Ref: [1] Carruthers, B. M. (2007).

With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.","Sample collection: Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in a greenhouse compartment of the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO, Melle, Belgium) and were subjected to normal cultural practices [1]. When tomato plants were 29 weeks old, 108 tomato fruits were collected from 4 tomato plants during a single harvest moment. Considering the days after anthesis (DAA), the harvested tomato fruits were classified into five groups (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), representing various developmental stages. Next, from each group, 10 fruits were selected for analysis. As such, different stages of fruit development and ripening were enclosed, whereby a wide range of carotenoid concentrations and divergent phytohormone profiles were covered. Selection of these fruits was each time realized in such a way that the number of different plants and trusses, from which the fruits originated, was maximized. For each single batch of 10 fruits, at least three different plants and thus at least three different trusses were considered. The consecutive cutting, lyophilization, grinding and sieving of each individual tomato fruit resulted in a homogenous powder, which allowed representative sampling. It should be noted that from the moment that the tomato fruits were harvested, they were kept cold (-20 \u00b0C) and shielded from light in order to prevent degradation of any fruit component.

Ionization source working parameters are: Auxiliary gas pressure 5 au; Sweep gas pressure 2 au; Heater temperature 330 \u00b0C; Capillary temperature 220 \u00b0C; Capillary voltage 65 (-62.5) V; Tube lens voltage 75 (-100) V; Skimmer voltage 24 (-27) V. An m\/z scan range of 100 - 800 was selected and the resolution was set at 100,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1 Hz (1 scan per second). The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at the high dynamic range (3 x 10^6 ions). Instrument control and data processing were carried out by Xcalibur 2.1 software. Because of the applied full-scan operating principle of this type of mass spectrometer and the associated metabolomic screening possibilities, the phytohormone profiles of the individual tomato fruits could be defined by means of chemometric data analysis. To ensure data quality for metabolomic screening purposes, system stability during analysis was verified by using matrix-matched calibration curves [1]. These curves (6 calibration levels) were set up in early-stage tomato fruit matrix and were run at the beginning and end of the batch of samples. For each of the major hormonal classes, at least one representative was considered. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 6) were obtained: 6.25% for abscisic acid, 5.07% for N6-benzyladenine, 6.93% for epibrassinolide, 6.26% for gibberellic acid, 5.97% for jasmonic acid, 9.26% for salicylic acid, 0.77% for zeatin, and 7.43% for indol-3-acetic acid.

The presented toxicity study followed two major strategies; the first was to establish an automated and easy to use untargeted metabolomics workflow for HPLC-MS data and second to find time- and dose dependent toxicant-induced cell responses at the metabolite level. The metabolomic changes were integrated with transcriptomics and proteomics data to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the mode of action. Automated data analysis workflows based on open-source software (OpenMS and KNIME) enable a comprehensive and reproducible analysis of the complex and voluminous metabolomics data produced by the profiling approach. For toxicity profiling of CAA, 428 and 317 metabolite features were detectable in positive and negative mode, respectively, after removal of chemical noise and unstable signals. Changes upon treatment were visually explored using principal component analysis and statistically significant differences identified using linear models (LIMMA). The analysis revealed toxic effects only for the high concentration treatment for day 3 and day 14. The most regulated metabolites were glutathione and metabolites related to the oxidative stress response of the cells. These findings are corroborated by proteomics and transcriptomics data, which show, amongst others, an activation of the Nrf2 pathway.","Sample collection: The human renal proximal tubule cell line RPTEC\/TERT1 was obtained from Evercyte GmbH (Vienna, Austria).

However, molecular changes at the metabolic level in the host central nervous system and pathogenesis-associated metabolites during brain infection are largely unexplored. We used a global metabolomics strategy to identify differentially regulated metabolites and affected metabolic pathways in BALB\/c mice during infection with T. gondii Pru strain at 7, 14 and 21 days post-infection (DPI). The non-targeted Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics analysis detected approximately 2,755 retention time-exact mass pairs, of which more than 60 had significantly differential profiles at different stages of infection. These include amino acids, organic acids, carbohydrates, fatty acids, and vitamins. The biological significance of these metabolites is discussed. Principal Component Analysis and Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis showed the metabolites\u2019 profile to change over time with the most significant changes occurring at 14 DPI. Correlated metabolic pathway imbalances were observed in carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, energetic metabolism and fatty acid oxidation. Eight metabolites correlated with the physical recovery from infection-caused illness were identified.

The mixture was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant (200 \u00b5l) was transferred to a new 1.5 ml polypropylene tube before liquid chromatography separation.","Chromatography: The Agilent 1290 Infinity LC System coupled to an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) (LC-Q\/TOF-MS) was run in a binary gradient solvent mode consisting of 0.1% (v\/v) formic acid\/water (solvent A) and 0.1% (v\/v) formic\/methanol (solvent B). The flow rate was 0.2 ml\/min. A C18 column (Agilent Technologies, Santa, Clara, CA) (1.8 \u00b5m, 100 x 2.1 mm) was used for all subsequent analysis. The linear gradient was as follows: 5% B at 0 min, 5% B at 2 min, 95% B at 17 min, and 95% B at 19 min.","Mass spec: Sample analysis was carried out in both positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) and negative ion (ESI ) modes. The column temperature was 45 \u00b0C and the injection volume was 5 \u00b5l. LC-MS data was acquired using an Agilent 1290 Infinity LC System coupled to an Agilent 6530 Accurate-Mass Quadrupole Time-of-Flight mass spectrometer. The mass scan range was 100-1000 m\/z. For positive ion mode, the capillary and cone voltage were set at 4 kV and 35 kV, respectively. Nitrogen was used as the dry gas. The desolvation gas was set to 600 l\/h at 350 \u00b0C; the cone gas was set to 50 l\/h and the source temperature was set to 100 \u00b0C. For negative ion mode, the capillary and cone voltage were set at 3.5kV and 50 kV, respectively. The desolvation gas was set to 700 l\/h at 300 \u00b0C; the cone gas was set to 50 l\/h and the source temperature was set to 100 \u00b0C. The mass spectrometry was operated in V optics mode and the data acquisition rate was set to 0.03 s, with interscan delay of 0.02 s. To ensure accuracy and reproducibility LockSpray was used in all analyses and Leucine-enkephalin was selected as the lockmass.","Data transformation: Agilent MassHunter Workstation QTOF Acquistition software (B.03.01) was used for data acquisition. LC-MS raw data files were converted into conmmon format (.mzdata), which was followed by data processing through the XCMS toolbox (http:\/\/metlin.scripps.edu\/xcms\/). Peak picking, peak grouping and retention time correction were all involved in data pre-treatment, which were done through the XCMS software that was implemented with the freely available R statistical language (v 2.13.1). The retention time (RT)-m\/z data pairs were used to indentify ion intensities of those detected peaks. The consistent variables (ion intensity information) were obtained by filtering peaks with 80 % missing values. In order to remove the offsets and adjust the importance of high and low abundance metabolites to an equal level, the data was preprocessed by both mean-centering and variance-scaling prior to multivariate analysis. Then, the resulting three-dimensional matrix that includes assigned peak indices (retention time-m\/z pairs), sample names and variables further went through the multivariate data analysis.","Metabolite id: Putative metabolites were first derived by searching the exact molecular mass data from redundant m\/z peaks against the online HMDB (http:\/\/www.hmdb.ca\/), METLIN (http:\/\/metlin.scripps.edu\/) and KEGG (www.genome.jp\/kegg\/) databases. A specific metabolite was sieved out when a match with a difference between observed and theoretical mass was less than 10 ppm. Then the metabolite molecular formula of matched metabolites was further identified by the isotopic distribution measurement."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS217","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS217","title":"Global Metabolomic Profiling of Mice Brains following Experimental Infection with the Cyst-Forming Toxoplasma gondii","date":"2017-01-27","timestamp":1485475200,"submitter":["Chun-Xue Zhou","Dong-Hui Zhou","Hany Elsheikha","Guang-Xue Liu","Xun Suo","Xing-Quan Zhu"],"publications":[{"title":"Global Metabolomic Profiling of Mice Brains following Experimental Infection with the Cyst-Forming Toxoplasma gondii.","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0139635","pubmed":"PMID:26431205"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"6530 Q-TOF LC\/MS (Agilent)","organism":"Mus musculus","organism_parts":"brain","metabolites":["PC (12:0)","Leukotriene D4","PC (18:0)","PE (21:0)","Guanosine","Guanine","Propionyl-L-carnitine","Hypoxanthine","Inosine","PE (P-16:0)","PC (15:0)","PE (18:0)","Acetylcarnitine","Eicosapentaenoic Acid","PC (15:1)","PE (18:1)","PC (18:2)","PC (18:3)","Selenocysteine","Sphinganine","Arginine","DG (28:2)","4-Phospho-L-aspartate","PC (10:0)","PA (18:3)","PI (22:2)","dUTP","N-acetylsphingosine 1-phosphate","L-gamma-Cyano-gamma-aminobutyric acid","gamma-Aminobutyric acid","Cytidine","O-Phosphorylethanolamine","DG (34:0)","Phosphocholine","L-Aspartic Acid","Taurine","Glutathione","Glycerophosphocholine"]}},"MTBLS111":{"description":["Carotenoids are important secondary metabolites, which have been recognized as an essential component of the human diet because of their valuable beneficial health effects. With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.","Sample collection: Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in a greenhouse compartment of the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO, Melle, Belgium) and were subjected to normal cultural practices [1]. When tomato plants were 29 weeks old, 108 tomato fruits were collected from 4 tomato plants during a single harvest moment. Considering the days after anthesis (DAA), the harvested tomato fruits were classified into five groups (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), representing various developmental stages. Next, from each group, 10 fruits were selected for analysis. As such, different stages of fruit development and ripening were enclosed, whereby a wide range of carotenoid concentrations and divergent phytohormone profiles were covered. Selection of these fruits was each time realized in such a way that the number of different plants and trusses, from which the fruits originated, was maximized. For each single batch of 10 fruits, at least three different plants and thus at least three different trusses were considered. The consecutive cutting, lyophilization, grinding and sieving of each individual tomato fruit resulted in a homogenous powder, which allowed representative sampling. It should be noted that from the moment that the tomato fruits were harvested, they were kept cold (-20 \u00b0C) and shielded from light in order to prevent degradation of any fruit component.

The column oven temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on an Exactive single-stage Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jos\u00e9, USA), operating at 100,000 FWHM, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II), operating in polarity switching mode. Ionization source working parameters are: Auxiliary gas pressure 5 au; Sweep gas pressure 2 au; Heater temperature 330 \u00b0C; Capillary temperature 220 \u00b0C; Capillary voltage 65 (-62.5) V; Tube lens voltage 75 (-100) V; Skimmer voltage 24 (-27) V. An m\/z scan range of 100 - 800 was selected and the resolution was set at 100,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1 Hz (1 scan per second). The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at the high dynamic range (3 x 10^6 ions). Instrument control and data processing were carried out by Xcalibur 2.1 software. Because of the applied full-scan operating principle of this type of mass spectrometer and the associated metabolomic screening possibilities, the phytohormone profiles of the individual tomato fruits could be defined by means of chemometric data analysis. To ensure data quality for metabolomic screening purposes, system stability during analysis was verified by using matrix-matched calibration curves [1]. These curves (6 calibration levels) were set up in early-stage tomato fruit matrix and were run at the beginning and end of the batch of samples. For each of the major hormonal classes, at least one representative was considered. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 6) were obtained: 6.25% for abscisic acid, 5.07% for N6-benzyladenine, 6.93% for epibrassinolide, 6.26% for gibberellic acid, 5.97% for jasmonic acid, 9.26% for salicylic acid, 0.77% for zeatin, and 7.43% for indol-3-acetic acid. Since these values were well below 15% [2], appropriate stability during analysis was concluded. Ref: [1] Van Meulebroek, L., Vanden Bussche, J., Steppe, K., and Vanhaecke, L. (2012).

From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation either in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) or in the C-trap (higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) experiments) and detected in the ion trap or the Orbitrap analyzer, respectively. For CID experiments, the 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms).

Analytes were PC 36:1 (m\/z 788.6-184) for positive ion mode and PE 36:2 (m\/z 742-279) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 15 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 450 \u00b0C; gas 1 50 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 60 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energies 30, 40, 45, 50, and 60 V. Source parameters for negative ion mode were: Curtain gas 10 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 4,500 V; temperature 600 \u00b0C; gas 1 20 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 95 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energies 30, 40, 45, 50, and 60 V. From each survey scan, the four most abundant ions exceeding 1,000 counts were chosen for enhanced product ion (EPI) scans at 4,000 Da\/s. Previously detected target ions were excluded for 10 s. Orbitrap Elite: MS\/MS data was acquired on an Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) in DDA mode. Source parameters for both polarities were as follows: Capillary temperature 380 \u00b0C; source heater temperature 380 \u00b0C; sheath gas 60 AU; aux gas 20 AU; sweep gas 5 AU. Source voltage was 3.5 kV and 5 kV for positive and negative ion mode, respectively. Full scan spectra in the range of m\/z 400 to 1,050 were acquired at a target resolution of 120,000 (FWHM at m\/z 400). The four most abundant ions from each spectrum were subjected to fragmentation in the C-trap, and the tandem mass spectra were recorded at a target resolution of 15,000 (FWHM at m\/z 400). Isolation width was 1.5 m\/z, activation time was 0.1 ms, normalized collision energy was 25 in positive ion mode and 50 in negative ion mode, and the exclusion time was 15 s. QTRAP 6500: The QTRAP 6500 (AB Sciex, Concord, ON, Canada), controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.2 software, operated in IDA mode, using an EMS scan from m\/z 400 to 1,000 at 10,000 Da\/s as a survey scan. Source parameters were automatically optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80% mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 34:1 (m\/z 760-184) for positive ion mode and PE 34:1 (m\/z 716-281) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 20 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 300 \u00b0C; gas 1 30 AU; gas 2 30 AU; declustering potential 100; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Source parameters for negative ion mode were: curtain gas 20; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 4,500 V; temperature 300 \u00b0C; gas 1 30 AU; gas 2 30 AU; declustering potential 150; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 10 V. From each survey scan, the eight most abundant ions exceeding 100,000 counts were chosen for EPI at 10,000 Da\/s. Previously detected target ions were excluded for a duration of 6 s. QTOF G6550A: The Agilent G6550A QTOF mass spectrometer was operated in AutoMSMS mode. From the full scan spectra, acquired from m\/z 100 to 1,700 at a rate of 4 spectra\/s, tandem mass spectra of the 15 most abundant precursor ions were acquired at a scan rate of 20 spectra\/s and a collision energy setting of 30. Previously detected target ions were excluded after three spectra for 9 s. Source parameters for positive and negative ion mode were as follows: Gas temperature 200 \u00b0C; gas flow 14 AU; nebulizer 35 AU; sheath gas temperature 350 \u00b0C; sheath gas flow 11 AU; capillary voltage 3,500 V; nozzle voltage 1,000 V; fragmentor 175; skimmer 65; octopole RF peak 750. Q Exactive: The Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in DDA mode. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Spray voltage 4.5 kV; aux gas heater temperature 375 \u00b0C; sheath gas 35 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 320 \u00b0C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Spray voltage 3.8 kV; aux gas heater temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 40 AU; aux gas 20 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. For both positive and negative ion mode, full scan spectra from m\/z 400 to 1,050 were acquired at a target resolution of 140,000 (FWHM at m\/z 200) from which ions were selected for fragmentation. Automatic gain control (AGC) target was set to 1e6 ions and the maximum injection time to 500 ms. For the DDA MS\/MS scan for both positive and negative ion mode, target resolution was set to 17,500 (FWHM at m\/z 200), AGC target to 5e4 ions, maximum injection time to 50 ms and isolation window to 1.5 m\/z. The 10 most abundant ions from the full scan spectra were selected for the MS\/MS scan. Normalized collision energy was 25 for positive ion mode and 30 for negative ion mode.","Data transformation: Data was transformed by msconvert to mzXML, and by LDA in chrom format.","Metabolite id: MS1 peaks were identified as described in an earlier paper [1] and MS\/MS spectra were interpreted by decision rule sets as described in the referenced paper of this study. For the metabolites assignment, a pipe \"|\" was used to discriminate between the individual MS runs, while comma \",\" was used to account for several identifications (e.g. several retention times) and ambiguous identifications (e.g. DG 20:0\/18:0\/-,20:0\/-\/18:0 corresponds to a diacylglyceride where 20:0 is identified to be on the sn-1 position, while 18:0 might be at sn-2 or sn-3).

healthcare and food industry in ingredients of plant origin as they are potent sources of antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and anticancer agents. In the present work different extracts of Phyllanthus niruri L. from various regions of Punjab were screened for their phenolic profiles and antioxidant properties. Crude extracts obtained by solid\u2013liquid extraction with different solvents were tested for total anthocyanins, flavonoids, phenolic content, and free radical scavenging activity. Out of all the solvents used, methanol was regarded as best to be used for soxhlet extraction of plant metabolites, as it provided highest phenolic, flavonoid, antioxidant, and anthocyanin contents. Similarly, ESI\u2013MS was employed to obtain mass profiles of phenolic and other metabolites present in various P. niruri populations. Out of 72 compounds detected, 51 are reported for the first time in P. niruri L. Similarly, different populations of P. niruri were discriminated through metabolic fingerprinting using ESI\u2013MS.","Sample collection: The Phyllanthus niruri samples were collected from various regions of Punjab, India viz. Bathinda, Amritsar, Roopnagar and Patiala. The collected populations were washed thoroughly under running water to remove soil and other extraneous matter. The samples were then shade dried properly for atleast a month and dried samples were crushed using electric grinder to get fine powder.","Extraction: Aqueous extract: P. niruri powders (500 g) from various regions of punjab (Amritsar, Bathinda, Patiala and Roopnagar) were macerated using 1 l of millipore water in a sterile glass container, stirred intermittently and then left overnight under hygienic conditions. After maceration, it was filtered through Whatmann filter paper (110 mm) and the filtrate was separated and stored asceptically in an air tight container at -20 \u00b0C until further analysis. Ethanolic and Methanolic Extract: For ethanolic extract of each region, soxhalation of the powder was achieved using ethanol as solvent. 500 g of powder was soxhalated using 1l of ethanol for 24 hr. Positive pressure (2-3 bar) was provided to evaporate solvent and to obtain ethanolic extract. Methanolic extract was prepared in the same way by using methanol as solvent. Hydroalcoholic Extract: Air dried plant powder of P. niruri was minced and extracted with 50% ethanol and water in 1:3 ratio. The fraction was then macerated at room temperature (25 \u00b1 3 \u00b0C) for 15 days. The solvent was evaporated and the extract was concentrated to desired level using vaccum evaporator and stored at -20 \u00b0C until furthur analysis.","Chromatography: None reported.","Mass spec: The crude extracts (aqueous, ethanolic, methanolic and hydroalcoholic) of Phyllanthus niruri from different districts were mixed with their corresponding solvents (1:9) and then centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernetant obtained was filtered through HEPA filters (0.47 micron membrane filter) and the filterates were further used for mass spectral analysis of phytochemicals present in P. niruri at NIPER (National Institute of Pharmaceutical Education and Research), Mohali, India.

Paired stomatal guard cells (GCs) are the gate-way for water, CO2, and pathogen, while mesophyll cells (MCs) represent the bulk cell-type of green leaves mainly for photosynthesis. We used the two different cell types, i.e., GCs and MCs from canola (Brassica napus) to profile metabolomic changes upon increased CO2 through supplementation with bicarbonate (HCO3-). Two metabolomics platforms enabled quantification of 268 metabolites in a time-course study to reveal short-term responses. The HCO3- responsive metabolomes of the cell types differed in their responsiveness. The MCs demonstrated increased amino acids, phenylpropanoids, redox metabolites, auxins and cytokinins, all of which were decreased in GCs in response to HCO3-. In addition, the GCs showed differential increases of primary C-metabolites, N-metabolites (e.g., purines and amino acids), and defense-responsive pathways (e.g., alkaloids, phenolics, and flavonoids) as compared to the MCs, indicating differential C\/N homeostasis in the cell-types. The metabolomics results provide insights into plant responses and crop productivity under future climatic changes where elevated CO2 conditions are to take center-stage.","Sample collection: Seeds of B. napus var. Global obtained from Sval\u00f6v Weibull AB (Sval\u00f6v, Sweden) were germinated in Metro-Mix 500 potting mixture (The Scotts Co., Marysville, OH, USA), and grown in growth chambers under a photosynthetic flux of 160 \u00b5mol photons\/m^2\/s with a photoperiod of 10 h at 24 \u00b0C in light and 20 \u00b0C in dark. Fully expanded leaves from seven week-old plants were used for GCs and MCs enrichment experiments. The metabolite standards were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Stock solutions of the 330 compounds were dissolved in appropriate solvents, and prepared as a dilution series in water. The metabolite standards used for the HPLC-MRM-MS library can be found in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study. These solutions were either used immediately or stored in -80 \u00b0C. Serially diluted stock standard metabolite solutions, ranging in concentration of 0.1\u2013100 pmol\/\u00b5l were used to verify the linear response in the mass spectrometer. 15 g of leaves with main veins removed were blended four times for 15 s each in cold distilled water using a 14-speed Osterizer blender (Oster Inc., Boca Raton, FL). The blended mixture was washed with cold distilled water on a 100 \u00b5m Nylon mesh until the flow through was clear of MCs, debris, and plastids. These epidermal peels were then subjected to enzymatic digestion (0.7% Calbiochem cellulysin, 0.025% Macerozyme R10, 0.1% PVP 40, 0.25% BSA) for 50 min in a shaking water bath at 140 rpm in dark. The digest was collected on a nylon mesh (100 \u00b5m) and was repeatedly washed using 750 ml of Basic solution (560 mM sorbitol, 5 mM MES, 0.5 mM CaCl2, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 10 \u00b5M KH2PO4, pH 5.5) to remove broken epidermal (pavement) cells. The enriched GCs were then incubated in stomata opening buffer (50 \u00b5M CaCl2, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.2) prepared in Basic solution for an hour in the growth chamber under plant growth conditions. The GC preparations were freshly used. MCs were isolated as previously described[1] except that the sucrose concentration was 0.7 M. The GCs and MCs were aliquoted in appropriate volumes, and NaHCO3 was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. Cells were incubated for 0, 5, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min on a shaker, and four replicates were generated for each data point. After treatment, the GCs and MCs were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored in -80 \u00b0C until metabolite extraction. Ref: [1] Chen S, Halkier BA.

The HPLC (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) used an autosampler (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) to inject the samples automatically. A C18-reverse phase (Gemini 5\u00b5; 150 x 2.0 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) analytical column was used with a C18 guard cartridge. The mobile phase consisted of two solvents, i.e., 0.1% formic acid in H2O (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B). The HPLC method was run with the following gradient program, i.e., 1:99, v\/v, at 0 min; 1:99, v\/v, at 0.2 min; 99.5:0.5, v\/v at 31 min; 99.5:0.5, v\/v at 34 min; 1:99, v\/v, at 34.2 min; 1:99 at 60 min at room temperature. Multiple blank solutions were prepared by adding only extraction solvent (buffer) and distilled water, respectively, whereas pooled samples were used as quality control (QC) runs for monitoring the chromatography and mass spectrometer conditions. GC-MS: 1 \u00b5l of the derivatized sample was injected in splitless mode into a GC-MS system consisting of an autosampler and a TSQ8000 Triple Quadrupole (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) or a 5977A Series GC\/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with an electron impact (EI) ionization source. Injection of the sample was performed at 250 \u00b0C with helium as a carrier gas and flow set to 2 ml\/min. GC was performed using a TR-5MS or HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m). The temperature program started isothermal at 70 \u00b0C for 1 min followed by a 6 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 300 \u00b0C and a final 11 min hold at 300 \u00b0C. The system was then temperature-equilibrated at 70 \u00b0C for 5 min before the next injection.","Mass spec: HPLC-MRM-MS\/MS: The HPLC was coupled to a hybrid triple quadrupole-ion trap (4000 Q-TRAP, AB Sciex, Foster City, CA, USA) mass spectrometer equipped with a TurboIonSpray (TIS) interface operated in both positive and negative ion modes. The electrospray ionization (ESI) parameters were: curtain gas (CUR) at 30 psi, the ion source (IS) at (+\/-) 4500 V, nebulizer gas (GS1) at 50 psi, TIS gas (GS2) at 55 psi and the TIS probe temperature at 350\u00b0C. To optimize analyte sensitivity, individual working solutions having the characteristic MRM transition with the optimal declustering potential (DP), collision energy (CE), cell exit potential (CXP) were selected for individual metabolites. Each transition was performed with a 15\u201340 ms dwell time to get a scan time around 1.2 ms for all the transitions analysed using a method including an enhanced MS scan and an enhanced product ion scan before switching to MRM mode. Essentially, QQQ experiments scans[1] were acquired as MRM experiments where a specific set of MRM transitions were monitored for each run period according to the metabolites eluted within this particular time-frame. We monitored 59 (5.8 min), 40 (9.9 min), 45 (7.9 min), 31 (12.5 min), and 18 (23.8 min) MRM transitions over five periods for the positive ionization mode. For the negative ionization mode, 66 and 11 MRM transitions were recorded for the first and second periods, respectively. Thus, each MRM transition was obtained with a 5-ms dwell time, and the scan mode change was set for 700 ms. The total cycle time was 1\u20131.5 s for the period, which ensured at least 10 points were obtained for each eluted peak. GC-MS: Mass spectra were collected on the TSQ8000 Triple Quadrupole (Thermo Scientific Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) and 5977A Series GC\/MSD (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) at 20 scans\/s with a range of m\/z 40\u2013600. The transfer line and the ion source temperatures were set to 250 \u00b0C. A standard alkane mixture (C8-C40) was injected at the beginning and end of the analysis for tentative identification and monitoring shifts in retention indices (RI).

GC-MS: The GC-MS data were aligned and processed as described[1]. Aligned data were deconvoluted using Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA). The filtered raw GC-MS data comprised of data from four biological replicates and 73 curated analytes.

","Metabolite id: HPLC-MRM-MS\/MS: The optimized parameters used for MRM experiments for each standard metabolite included in HPLC-MRM-MS\/MS library are provided in Table S1 in the paper associated with this study. GC-MS: Metabolites were identified by comparing fragmentation patterns available in the MSRI spectral libraries of Golm Metabolome Database available from Max-Planck-Institute for Plant Physiology, Golm, Germany (http:\/\/csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de\/csbdb\/gmd\/gmd.html) by matching the mass spectra and RI[1]. Additional peak identification was confirmed by comparing against the NIST Mass Spectral Reference Library (NIST08\/2008, National Institute of Standards and Technology, USA). Peak finding and quantification of selective ion traces were accomplished using AMDIS software. As a rule, if a compound had an AMDIS match factor of >60% and a probability score >20% as well as a matching RI to a known compound it was considered \u201cprobable\u201d. Peak areas were normalized by dividing each peak area value by the area of the internal standard for a specific sample, and were further median normalized. Individual metabolite quantification data were assembled into a joint data set which included those measured by the targeted HPLC-MRM-MS.

A systems-level understanding spanning temporal molecular and metabolic controls is needed to define the cellular behavior that confers advantages in water-limited conditions. Here, we report high-resolution temporal behaviors of transcript, protein, and metabolite abundances across a CAM diel cycle and, where applicable, compare those observations to the well-established C3 model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. A mechanistic finding that emerged is that CAM operates with a shifted altered redox poise relative to Arabidopsis thaliana. Moreover, we identify widespread rescheduled expression for genes associated with signal transduction mechanisms that are presented in guard cells to regulate stomatal opening\/closing. Controlled production and degradation of transcript and proteins is a timing mechanism by which to regulate cellular function, yet knowledge of how this molecular timekeeping regulates CAM physiology is unknown. Here, we provide new insight into complex, post-transcriptional and -translational hierarchies that govern CAM in Agave. These data sets together provide a resource that could inform efforts to engineer traits of the more efficient CAM plant into economically valuable C3 crops.","Sample collection: Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) plants used for gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) measurements were obtained from TAIR (http:\/\/www.arabidopsis.org\/).

The plants were watered once weekly until drainage from the pots occurred. fully-expanded leaf samples collected every at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 hr after the starting of the light period.","Extraction: Fast-frozen tissues were ground with liquid nitrogen in a chilled mortar and pestle with ~50 (19-60) mg FW Agave leaf subsequently twice extracted with 2.5 ml 80% ethanol overnight and then combined prior to drying a 1.0 ml aliquot in a nitrogen stream. A 50 \u00b5l aliquot was also dried for analysis of high concentration metabolites. For Arabidopsis, ~120 (52-161) mg FW of fast-frozen plant tissue was twice extracted with 2.0 ml 80% ethanol overnight and then combined prior to drying a 0.5 ml aliquot in a nitrogen stream. Sorbitol (75 \u00b5l of a 1 mg\/ml aqueous solution) was added to the first 80% ethanol extraction volume into which the frozen tissue was directly weighed before for extraction as an internal standard to correct for differences in extraction efficiency, subsequent differences in derivatization efficiency and changes in sample volume during heating. Dried extracts were dissolved in 500 \u00b5l of silylation\u2013grade acetonitrile followed by the addition of 500 \u00b5l N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Bellefonte, PA), and samples were then heated for 1-hr at 70 \u00b0C to generate trimethylsilyl (TMS) derivatives[1][2].

Metabolite peaks were extracted using a key selected ion, characteristic m\/z fragment, rather than the total ion chromatogram, to minimize integrating co-eluting metabolites. The extracted peaks of known metabolites were scaled back up to the total ion current using predetermined scaling factors. Peaks were quantified by area integration and concentrations normalized to the quantity of the internal standard (sorbitol) recovered, amount of sample extracted, derivatized, and injected. A large user created database (>2300 spectra) of mass spectral electron impact ionization (EI) fragmentation patterns of TMS-derivatized compounds, as well as the Wiley Registry 10th Edition combined with NIST 14 mass spectral database, were used to identify the metabolites of interest to be quantified. Unidentified metabolites were denoted by their retention time as well as mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratios. The Agave data (see Supplemental Table 2 of the paper associated with this study) and Arabidopsis data (see Supplemental Table 3) have been provided. Because we highlight the relative abundances of metabolites for both succulent leaves (i.e., Agave) and standard leaves (i.e., Arabidopsis), we compared the relative abundances of metabolites using both fresh weight and dry weight as normalizing measures. For both plants, we did not observe a substantial difference between the two methods (Supplemental Figure 1).

Here we show that an abundant marine cyanobacterium, Synechococcus elongatus, contributes a variety of nitrogen-rich and sulfur-containing compounds to dissolved organic matter. A combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics and genomic tools was used to characterize the intracellular and extracellular metabolites of S. elongatus. Aromatic compounds such as 4-hydroxybenzoic acid and phenylalanine, as well as nucleosides (e.g., thymidine, 5\u2019-methylthioadenosine, xanthosine), the organosulfur compound 3-mercaptopropionate, and the plant auxin indole 3-acetic acid, were detected in the extracellular metabolites at multiple time points during the growth of S. elongatus. Further, the amino acid kynurenine was found to accumulate in the media even though it was not included in the predicted metabolome of S. elongatus. This suggests that not all metabolites produced by an organism can be predicted from its genome sequence. Some metabolites may be products of non-enzymatic reactions and are likely excreted into the environment as waste. The compounds described herein provide excellent targets for quantitative analysis in field settings to assess the source and lability of dissolved organic matter in situ.","Sample collection: Synechococcus elongatus CCMP 1631 was purchased from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay, ME, USA) and grown in 300 ml of L1-Si media (https:\/\/ncma.bigelow.org\/algal-recipes) using Turks Island Salts as a base. A starter culture in exponential phase was used to inoculate 12 flasks of media with 10% of the volume (30 ml). Another six flasks contained only the media as cell-free controls. The cultures were maintained at room temperature under a 12:12 light:dark regime (56 \u03bcmol\/m2\/s) and were sampled at approximately 30 min into the light cycle, at each time point. Cultures were grown for three weeks and samples were taken on days: 0, 2, 8, 10, 15, and 17. Cells were captured by gentle vacuum filtration on 0.2 \u00b5m Omnipore (Millipore) filters. The filtrate was acidified to a pH=3 and extracted immediately. The filters were stored at 80 \u00baC until extraction could occur in one batch for the entire experiment.","Extraction: The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol described by [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v\/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g\/ml) as an internal standard. For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg\/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile. The filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g\/6 cc cartridges. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 500 \u00b5l of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Ref: [1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 minutes, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 minutes, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 minutes. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng\/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration.

For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS\/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ).

Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m\/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps.

For example, triple negative breast cancer cells (ER-\/PR-\/Her2-) show reduced susceptibility towards radiotherapy and chemotherapeutic agents. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have shown promising results in clinical trials, both as single agents and in combination with other chemotherapeutics, in several subtypes of breast cancer patients. PARP1 is involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, and transcriptional regulation and an understanding of the effects of PARP inhibitors, specifically on metabolism, is currently lacking. Here, we have used NMR-based metabolomics to probe the cell line-specific effects of PARP inhibitor and radiation on metabolism in three distinct breast cancer cell lines. Our data reveal several cell line independent metabolic changes upon PARP inhibition, including an increase in taurine. Pathway enrichment and topology analysis identified that nitrogen metabolism, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism were enriched after PARP inhibition in the three breast cancer cell lines. We observed that the majority of metabolic changes due to radiation as well as PARP inhibition were cell line dependent, highlighting the need to understand how these treatments affect cancer cell response via changes in metabolism. Finally, we observed that both PARP inhibition and radiation induced a similar metabolic response in the HCC1937 (BRCA mutant cell line), but not in MCF-7 and MDAMB231 cells, suggesting that radiation and PARP inhibition share similar interactions with metabolic pathways in BRCA mutant cells. Our study emphasizes the importance of differences in metabolic responses to cancer treatments in different subtypes of cancers.","Sample collection: NMR sample collection was performed as follows. The cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4) and then the cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol as it gives better extraction efficiency and provides rapid quenching as compared to other methods. The cells were then detached using a cell scraper and pipetted into a 50 ml centrifuge tube.","Extraction: The quenched cells were suspended in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water (6:6:5.4) to make a final volume of 17.4 ml.

Recently, the focus on metabolism has been reemphasized as critical signaling and regulatory pathways of human pathophysiology, ranging from cancer to aging, often converge on metabolic responses. Here, we used genome-scale modeling and multi-omics (transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) analysis to assess metabolic features that are critical for macrophage activation. A genome-scale metabolic network for the RAW 264.7 cell line was constructed to determine metabolic modulators of activation. Metabolites well-known to be associated with immunoactivation (glucose and arginine) and immunosuppression (tryptophan and vitamin D3) were among the most critical effectors. Intracellular metabolic mechanisms were assessed, identifying a suppressive role for de-novo nucleotide synthesis. Finally, underlying metabolic mechanisms of macrophage activation were identified by analyzing multi-omic data obtained from LPS-stimulated RAW cells in the context of our flux-based predictions. This study demonstrates that the role of metabolism in regulating activation may be greater than previously anticipated and elucidates underlying connections between activation and metabolic effectors. This submission corresponds to the metabolomics data from this study.","Sample collection: Macrophages (RAW 264.7 cells) were seeded at a density of 3.0E6 cells in 150 mm dishes using Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, then grown for 2 days and stimulated for 24 hours with 100 ng\/ml of lipopolysaccharide diluted in fresh medium.

MetaboliteDetector software was used for database matching and batch identification\/quantification parameters are as follows: required score, 0.6; \u0394RI, 25; minimum S\/N, 20; maximum peak discrepancy index, 100. Ions 73 and 143 were excluded from use as metabolite quantification ions, since these are due to fragmentation of the trimethylsilyl groups. Otherwise, three unique fragment ions were assigned to each metabolite for quantification and used for each individual GC-MS analysis when processing the data in batch mode. The summed areas of the three quantification ions were exported from MetaboliteDetector and used in further statistical anayses.

Although formerly regarded as extracellular pathogen, it has been shown that S. aureus can also be internalized by host cells and persist within these cells. In the present study, we comparatively analyzed survival and physiological adaptation of S. aureus HG001 after internalization by two human lung epithelial cell lines (S9 and A549), and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK 293). Combining enrichment of bacteria from host-pathogen assays by cell sorting and quantitation of the pathogen's proteome by mass spectrometry we characterized S. aureus adaptation during the initial phase between 2.5 h and 6.5 h post-infection. Starting with about 2 \u00d7 10^6 bacteria, roughly 1450 S. aureus proteins, including virulence factors and metabolic enzymes were identified by spectral comparison and classical database searches. Most of the bacterial adaptation reactions, such as decreased levels of ribosomal proteins and metabolic enzymes or increased amounts of proteins involved in arginine and lysine biosynthesis, enzymes coding for terminal oxidases and stress responsive proteins or activation of the sigma factor SigB were observed after internalization into any of the three cell lines studied. However, differences were noted in central carbon metabolism including regulation of fermentation and threonine degradation. Since these differences coincided with different intracellular growth behavior, complementary profiling of the metabolome of the different non-infected host cell types was performed. This revealed similar levels of intracellular glucose but host cell specific differences in the amounts of amino acids such as glycine, threonine or glutamate. With this comparative study we provide an impression of the common and specific features of the adaptation of S. aureus HG001 to specific host cell environments as a starting point for follow-up studies with different strain isolates and regulatory mutants. Metabolome analysis, by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was performed for the infection medium (extracellular medium, mock infection of 1 h).","Sample collection: Bacterial strain and cultivation conditions: S. aureus strain HG001 [1] carrying plasmid pMV158GFP [2] was used throughout the study. Bacteria were cultivated in prokaryotic minimal essential medium (pMEM) until the exponential growth phase (OD600 0.4) as described previously [3]. The number of bacterial cells present in the culture at OD600 was determined by flow cytometry with a Guava easyCyte\u2122 flow cytometer (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) using GFP constitutively expressed from pMV158GFP. Cell lines and cultivation conditions: S9 cells [adeno 12 SV40 hybrid virus-transformed human bronchial epithelial cells, ATCC\u00ae number CRL-2778 and A549 cells [human lung cancer-derived alveolar epithelial cells, ATCC\u00ae number CCL-185, were cultivated in eukaryotic minimal essential medium (eMEM) as described previously (Pf\u00f6rtner et al., 2013). HEK 293 cells [adenovirus type 5-transformed human embryonic kidney cells were cultivated in modified eMEM for HEK 293 cells (HEK-eMEM; 1\u00d7MEM [Biochrom AG), supplemented with additional 10% (v\/v) dialyzed fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen), 2% (v\/v) L-glutamine (PAA), 1% (v\/v) sodium pyruvate (PAA), and 1% (v\/v) non-essential amino acids (PAA)]. Cells were cultured in 10-cm-diameter tissue culture plates at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 in a humid atmosphere. Prior to infection experiments, host cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates 3 days in advance and cultivated until confluence. Internalization settings: S. aureus HG001 pMV158GFP was cultivated in pMEM until OD600 0.4. Based on a calibration curve, an infection mix of bacterial culture was prepared in host cell medium buffered with 2.2 g\/l sodium hydrogen carbonate. Bacterial cultures were diluted in this mix to infect host cells with a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 25. Afterwards, the cell culture medium of confluent host cells was replaced by this infection mix, and bacteria could sediment, attach to and be internalized by host cells in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 1 h. Subsequently, one ml of host cell supernatant containing non-internalized bacteria was collected to represent the non-adherent control. The remaining infection mix was replaced by host cell medium containing 10 \u03bcg\/ml lysostaphin (AMBI PRODUCTS LLC, Lawrence, NY, USA). Non-internalized S. aureus cells were killed efficiently in this step within 30 min [4]. After 2.5 h and 6.5 h supernatant was removed and cell layers were washed twice with PBS. Host cells were lysed with 0.1% Triton X-100 in water for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C and rinsed afterwards with PBS.

The genome of the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, encodes multiple members of this family, one of which, gABCG2, is transcribed predominantly in the gametocyte stage. Here we use gene deletion and tagging to investigate the expression, localization and function of gABCG2. The protein is found in a single dot-like lipid-rich structure within female, but not male, gametocytes. gABCG2-knockout cell lines produce more gametocytes of both sexes. By contrast, cholesteryl esters, diacylglycerols and triacylglycerols are significantly reduced in gABCG2-knockout gametocyte stages. We propose a role for gABCG2 in the regulation of gametocyte numbers and in the accumulation of neutral lipids, which are likely important for parasite development in the insect stages of the parasite life cycle.","Sample collection: Each analysis was performed on three independent biological samples.

For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 \u00b0C and matches ion source conditions. The n-alkanes used to calculate are retention time index were as follows: decane, dodecane, pentadecane, octadecane, nonadecane, docosane, octacosane, dotriacontane, hexatriacontane.

However, the use of GC-EI MS in untargeted metabolomics produces large and complex datasets characterized by coeluting compounds and extensive fragmentation of molecular ions caused by the hard electron ionization. In order to identify and extract quantitative information of metabolites across multiple biological samples, integrated computational workflows for data processing are needed. Here we introduce eRah, a free computational tool written in the open language R composed of five core functions: (i) noise filtering and baseline removal of GC-MS chromatograms, (ii) an innovative compound deconvolution process using multivariate analysis techniques based on compound match by local covariance (CMLC) and orthogonal signal deconvolution (OSD), (iii) alignment of mass spectra across samples, (iv) missing compound recovery, and (v) identification of metabolites by spectral library matching using publicly available mass spectra. eRah outputs a table with compound names, matching scores and the integrated area of compounds for each sample. The automated capabilities of eRah are demonstrated by the analysis of GC-TOF MS data from plasma samples of adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and healthy controls. The quantitative results of eRah are compared to centWave, the peak-picking algorithm implemented in the widely used XCMS package, MetAlign and ChromaTOF software. Significantly dysregulated metabolites are further validated using pure standards and targeted analysis by GC-QqQ MS, LC-QqQ and NMR.","Sample collection: A dataset of a total of 25 plasma samples (11 young, non-obese adolescents with hyperinsulinaemic androgen excess and 14 age-, weight- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls) were analyzed by GC-EI-qTOF-MS (Agilent Technologies)[1].

The chloroform fraction of 24 different grape varieties, of which about half were white and half red types, was collected and pooled. Two different pooled grape sets were prepared, each pool containing different grape varieties. For the first experimental set, \u201cNo TEA,\u201d the pooled fraction was divided into 500 \u00b5l aliquots, dried using centrifugal evaporation at room temperature, and stored at -20 \u00b0C. For the second experimental set, \u201cTEA,\u201d 0.1% of triethylamine was added to the pooled fraction, which was then divided into aliquots and dried as before. The dry TEA samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C. In the experimental set with TEA as an internal standard, trans beta-Apo-8\u2019-carotenal, was added to the pooled extract before aliquoting. Before injection, samples were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of ethyl acetate, briefly vortexed, centrifuged for 2 min at 14,000 x g and transferred to dark vials.","Chromatography: Chromatography was carried out on these samples as described before [1], with some small modifications. Briefly, chromatography was performed in a 1290 Agilent UPLC equipped with an RP C30 3 \u00b5m column (250 x 2.1 mm i.d.) coupled to a 20 x 4.6 mm C30 guard column (YMC Inc., Wilmington, NC, USA). A flow rate of 0.21 ml\/min and an injection volume of 3 \u00b5l were adopted. The mobile phases consisted of methanol (A) and tert-methyl butyl ether (B), both containing 5% of a mixture of water\/methanol (20\/80 by volume) and 0.2% (w\/v) ammonium acetate. The gradient elution consisted of 100% A isocratically for 6 min, a step to 82.5% A at 7 min, maintained isocratically for 5 min, followed by a linear gradient to 32.5% A by 30 min, these conditions were maintained for 14 min. A conditioning phase (48\u201360 min) was then used to return the column the initial concentration of A. The DAD signal was acquired from 200 to 600 nm (step 1.2 nm) with a slit width of 1 nm, at a frequency of 2.5 Hz. The data set analyzed here includes chromatograms corresponding to the injection of the following: \u2013 The ten standards, each injected once; \u2013 No TEA samples, immediately after preparation (day 0) and at regular periods afterwards. In total, ten samples of this class have been injected, the last one after 29 days; \u2013 TEA samples, immediately after preparation (day 0) and at regular periods afterwards. One replicate injection was performed at day 0. The final sample was injected after 28 days - in total, 14 TEA samples have been injected. These 34 samples are then analyzed simultaneously.

No unimodality or selectivity constraints were imposed. The MCR algorithm was started using initial guesses from orthogonal projection approach (OPA), using eight components for each individual time window. The number of eight components was chosen to be sufficient to cover all expected compounds plus a few unexpected ones. OPA was initialized with the spectra of those standards known to be eluting in the corresponding time windows, and the rest of the eight components were found by the OPA algorithm. Again, to ensure complete automation, no attempt was made at this stage to optimize the number of components. The MCR algorithm was allowed to run for at most 1,000 iterations. If the default convergence criterion was met, the run was terminated earlier. MCR models were then stored for visualization and further inspection. Postprocessing of the basic MCR models serves to simplify, validate, and improve the initial results. Two aspects in particular are addressed here. Firstly, one may check for the possible overestimation or underestimation of the number of components in the MCR analysis. Underestimation will result in high residuals and a bad description of the system. If so, additional components may be added until a correct description is obtained. Overestimation of components may be detected when two or more elution profiles of different MCR components show a very high correlation coefficient. If this happens, one may hypothesize that these components need to be combined. In the case of multimodal elution profiles, caused by compounds with similar or equal spectral characteristics, we use a simple peak-finding algorithm to identify all individual peaks in the elution profile and approximate the corresponding peak areas by fitting Gaussian profiles. The locations of the peaks are given by the peak maxima, and the peak widths are determined using the full widths at half maximum. Only peaks with a maximum intensity above a threshold of 20 units are considered. This threshold has been determined empirically and can be changed easily if visual inspection of the elution profiles indicates the need to do so. After building the final MCR models, they should be validated in terms of model fit. The resulting elution profiles and spectra can be interpreted. Spectra can be compared to spectra from a library or evaluated on the presence and absence of expected features. Elution profiles can be evaluated easily on the basis of peak shapes and intensities. Unequivocal identification can be done on the basis of spectral characteristics and retention times in cases where standards are available. MCR was used according to the functions in packages ALS (http:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/package=ALS), data analysis was performed using R (http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/)."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS85","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS85","title":"High-throughput carotenoid profiling using multivariate curve resolution (Stability of isoprenoids in grape extract)","date":"2014-07-01","timestamp":1404169200,"submitter":["Ron Wehrens","Elisabete Carvalho"],"publications":[{"title":"High-throughput carotenoid profiling using multivariate curve resolution","doi":"10.1007\/s00216-012-6555-9","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"TSQ Quantum Ultra (Thermo Scientific)","organism":["reference compound","Vitis vinifera"],"organism_parts":["pure substance","berry"]}},"MTBLS126":{"description":["Resveratrol (RESV) is a plant polyphenol, which is thought to have beneficial metabolic effects in laboratory animals as well as in humans. Following oral administration, RESV is immediately catabolized, resulting in low bioavailability. This study compared RESV metabolites and their tissue distribution after oral uptake and skin absorption. Metabolomic analysis of various mouse tissues revealed that RESV can be absorbed and metabolized through skin. We detected sulfated and glucuronidated RESV metabolites, as well as dihydroresveratrol. These metabolites are thought to have lower pharmacological activity than RESV. Similar quantities of most RESV metabolites were observed 4 h after oral or skin administration, except that glucuronidated RESV metabolites were more abundant in skin after topical RESV application than after oral administration. This result is consistent with our finding of glucuronidated RESV metabolites in cultured skin cells. RESV applied to mouse ears significantly suppressed inflammation in the TPA inflammation model. The skin absorption route could be a complementary, potent way to achieve therapeutic effects with RESV. <\/p> One mg of RESV dissolved in ethanol was applied directly (Et) or mixed with hydrophilic ointment (HO), macrogol (Ma) or CMC gel (CMC), and swabbed on mouse dorsal skin.

HEPES and PIPES were used as internal standards to correct for the variation of sample preparation and different detection efficiency. After brief vortexing samples were centrifuged at 500 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was recovered for further processing. For metabolite extraction 0.2 ml of blood were mixed with 1.8 ml 55% methanol pre-chilled to -40 \u00b0C. Internal standards (HEPES and PIPES) were added and samples kept until further processing. To remove proteins, metabolome samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10 kDa cut-off filters (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

A single-blind, dose-dependent, parallel randomized controlled dietary intervention was conducted where volunteers (n = 126) were randomly assigned to one of three diets: high flavonoid diet, low flavonoid diet or habitual diet as a control for 18 weeks. High resolution LC\u2013MS untargeted metabolomics with minimal sample cleanup was performed using an Orbitrap mass spectrometer. Putative biomarkers which characterize diets with high and low flavonoid content were selected by state-of-the-art data analysis strategies and identified by HR-MS and HR-MS\/MS assays. Discrimination between diets was observed by application of two linear mixed models: one including a diet-time interaction effect and the second containing only a time effect. Valerolactones, phenolic acids and their derivatives were among sixteen biomarkers related to the high flavonoid dietary exposure. Four biomarkers related to the low flavonoid diet belonged to the family of phenolic acids. For the first time abscisic acid glucuronide was reported as a biomarker after a dietary intake, however its origins have to be examined by future hypothesis driven experiments using a more targeted approach. This metabolomic analysis has identified a number of dose dependent urinary biomarkers (i.e. proline betaine or iberin-N-acetyl cysteine), which can be used in future observation and intervention studies to assess flavonoids and non-flavonoid phenolic intakes and compliance to fruit and vegetable intervention.","Sample collection: Two cohorts of men and women, aged 26\u201370 yrs, were recruited to the FLAVURS trial from the population in and around Reading, UK.

Participants attended 4 clinical visits at the Hugh Sinclair Unit of Human Nutrition (week 0, 6, 12 and 18), where measurements of vascular function were performed and fasting blood and 24-h urine samples were collected. A total of 174 participants (68 men, 106 women) commenced the study, with 154 (60 men, 94 women) completing all 4 visits. Samples from 126 volunteers (42 persons per diet) resulting in a total of 504 24-h urine samples on which untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed.Details regarding the diets were as follows: participants in the HF group received F&V which contained >=15 mg\/100 g flavonoids. Participants assigned to the LF dietary group received F&V <5 mg\/100 g flavonoids.

The conditions in ESI positive (and negative) mode were: source voltage 5.0 kV (3.5 kV), heated capillary temperature 320 \u00b0C, capillary voltage 30 V (-30 V) and tube lens 110 V (-110 V). In the LTQ component of the instrument, nitrogen was used as both the sheath gas (70 U) and auxiliary gas (30 U), and helium was used as the damping gas. All measurements were done using the automatic gain control of the LTQ to adjust the number of ions entering the trap.

Physiological changes of the rice isogenic lines were different based on the quantitative trait loci of BPH resistance. Multivariate models were capable of distinguishing between the susceptible and the resistant rice varieties throughout the infestation. The concentration of 10 metabolites were significantly altered (p < 0.05) between the infested and the control groups of each examined rice variety. Metabolic pathway analysis suggested that BPH infestation could perturb transamination during the early stages of infestation (days 1\u20133) for all rice varieties. In addition, the IL7 and IL308 varieties responded earlier (day 3) than the KD variety (day 8) by perturbing amino acid metabolism, shikimate and gluconeogenesis pathways. By day 8 of the infestation, the KD cultivar responded by activating the amino acid-mediated-de novo pathway whereas the IL308 variety activated the purine and pyrimidine compound-mediated-salvage pathway for nucleotide biosynthesis. This study has identified, for the first time, several potential metabolic pathways for acclimatization and defense mechanisms against BPH infestation. These findings provide a valuable, first insight into BPH resistance mechanisms in Thai Jasmine rice.","Sample collection: Rice and brown planthopper samples: For rice varieties, one BPH-susceptible cultivar, Thai Jasmine rice (KD) and two BPH-resistant isogenic lines (ILs); strain UBN03078-101-342-4-7 (IL7) and UBN3078-101- 432-6-308 (IL308), were utilized to identify differential metabolomic profiles during BPH infestation at various time points. The IL7 and IL308 were the BPH-resistance-ILs of KD contain Bph3 only and Bph3 plus the terpene synthase (TPS) gene, respectively [1]. For BPH, the Ubon Rachathani population (UBN-BPH) was cultured and manipulated in a standard BPH-susceptible Taichung Native 1 (TN1) rice cultivar enclosure [2]. For rice samples, all examined rice varieties were grown in a total of 90 pots (30 pots\/each; pot dimensions: 20 cm in diameter and 18 cm in height) with 3 plants per pot in a greenhouse with 13 h (06:00\u201319:00) light and 11 h (19:00\u201306:00) dark cycles for 45 days (tilling stage) before plants were equally divided into two groups (control and BPH treatment, 15 pots\/group). For each group, samples were collected at five time points (1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 days; 3 pots\/day\/group). Effects of BPH infestation on the 3 varieties were investigated by dividing each variety into 2 groups: a control group (without BPH feeding) and a treatment group (with BPH feeding). Brown planthopper (BPH) treatment and rice sample collection: For the BPH treatment group, each rice variety in the group was separately transferred into an aluminum cage before being treated with BPH. The cage was covered with plastic mesh (1 mm diameter) to prevent the BPH to migrate between the different rice isogenic lines. In each cage, 25\u201330 second- to third-instar BPH nymphs were introduced to each plant (15 pots\/variety\/cage). In parallel, control groups were maintained in separate aluminum cages covered with plastic mesh without the introduction of BPH nymphs. For sample collection, a homogeneous pool of 3 plants\/pot of leaf samples from three different varieties in both control and treatment groups were collected on days 1, 2, 3, 4 and 8, respectively. The samples were collected at the same time daily beginning at 09:00 for control groups followed by BPH treatment groups at 13:00. Rice varieties were collected in the same order for both control and BPH treatment groups. The samples were cut using scissors on the lowest point of the leaf sheath at ground level. Leaf samples (approximately 60\u2013100 cm tall) including leaf sheathes and leaf blades were collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. All frozen samples were lyophilized (Modulyo, Thermo Scientific, USA), ground to a fine powder (Phillip HR2020, USA) and sieved to remove any large particulates.

","Sample collection: The dried samples were reconstituted in 1 ml of deuterium oxide (Sigma, cat no. 151882) containing 0.081 lM of the internal standard 3-(trimethylsilyl) propionic-2,2,3,3-d4 acid sodium salt (TSP; Sigma, cat no. 269913) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (PB, pH 7.0). The reconstituted samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and 600 \u03bcl of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for analysis.","Nmr spec: All spectral data were acquired on a 400 MHz 1H Avance III NMR spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) at 300 K.","Nmr assay: Using a randomized running order one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were acquired across a spectral width of 8.2 kHz into 32 K data points: Relaxation delay = 5 s, t1 = 6 ms. A total of 128 transients were acquired. As with standard one-dimensional spectra, the summed transients were multiplied by a 0.3 Hz apodisation factor prior to Fourier Transformation; chemical shifts (d) are reported in parts per million (ppm) of the operating frequency and were referenced to the TSP resonance (d = 0.00). Replication of results was insured by running a single sample throughout the experiment and direct comparison of the acquired spectra was used as a measure of reproducibility and quality control [1].

PMID:22370585 ","Data transformation: All the sample spectra were phased and baselines were manually corrected using ACDlabs version 12.0 (Toronto, Canada). Data reduction was carried out by manually binning the spectra and measuring the integral for each bin\/bucket between d0.00 and d8.50 ppm\u2014a total of 197 buckets were recorded. The region from d4.70 to d4.90 ppm, which contained the residual water signal, was excluded. The integrals were normalized to the total spectral intensity prior to chemometric analysis.","Metabolite id: The spectral integrals were identified by comparing their chemical shift and multiplicity to public and commercial databases such as Chenomx NMR Profiler version 7.6 (Chenomx NMR suite 7.6, Chenomx Inc., Canada), the Human Metabolome database [1][2][3] and the Madison metabolome consortium database [4]. The identified metabolites were confirmed using 2D 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy (COSY), 1H-13C heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) and spiking with pure compounds. The metabolite were identified according to minimum reporting standards for chemical analysis [5]. For the chemometric analysis, all spectral integrals were mean centered and Pareto scaled using SIMCA P version 13.0.1 (Umetric, Sweden). Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to generate models to examine the effects of different factors, namely: the rice varieties, the BPH treatment and the time points of the experiment.

The main source of AR is the dried root of Astragalus membranaceus var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao in China, and both cultivated and wild ARs are used in the clinic. Systematic comparison of cultivated AR and wild AR should be performed to ensure the efficacy and safety in clinic. In this study, the chemical compositions of two different ARs, collected in Shanxi (wild) and Gansu (cultivated) Provinces, were compared by NMR based metabolic fingerprint coupled with multivariate analysis. Then SX-AR and GS-AR induced metabolic changes of endogenous metabolites in mice were also compared. The results showed that SX-AR and GS-AR differed significantly not only in the primary metabolites, but also the secondary metabolites. However, alterations of endogenous metabolites in serum, lung, liver and spleen were relatively small between them. This study provided a novel and valuable method for consistency and diversity evaluation of herbal drugs, and further studies should be conducted on the difference of polysaccharide as well as biological effect between the two kinds of ARs.","Sample collection: Plant materials: Astragali Radix (AR) samples were collected at the same time of year from the same planting area from Hunyuan County, Shanxi Province (SX-AR) and Minxian County, Gansu Province (GS-AR) of China, respectively. The voucher specimens were deposited in the herbarium of Modern Research Center for Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanxi University. Serum and tissue samples: The freeze-dried extract (see Extraction section below) was suspended in distilled water to 1.0 g\/ml, which is equivalent to the crude drug. According to the extraction yields, the final concentrations of SX-AR and GS-AR were 0.31 and 0.33 g\/ml, respectively. For the low dose group, the drug concentration was diluted to 0.25 g\/ml (equivalent to the crude drug). The animal study was performed according to the International Rules Concerning Animal Experiments and the Internationally Accepted Ethical Principles for Laboratory Animal Use and Care. Male 4-week-old Kunming (KM) mice, weighing 18\u201322 g, were purchased from the Experimental Animal Center of the Academy of Military Medical Sciences of the Chinese People\u2019s Liberation Army [SCXK (Military) 2012\u20130004]. All animals were housed at room temperature (20\u201325 \u00b0C) and constant humidity (40\u201370%) under a 12 h light\/dark cycle in Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) grade laboratory conditions. Animals were allowed to have access to food and water ad libitum except for fasting periods before experiments. After a 1 week adaptive feeding period, KM mice were randomly divided into 5 groups (n = 8) for a 7 day treatment intervention: a control group (NS), a GS-AR low dose group (GS-AR-L), a GS-AR high dose group (GS-AR-H), an SX-AR low dose group (SX-AR-L), and an SX-AR high dose group (SX-AR-H). Aqueous extracts of AR were administrated into the mice via gavage for the low dose (5 g\/kg, equivalent to the crude drug) and high dose (20 g\/kg, equivalent to the crude drug) groups, and the control group was given the same volume of distilled water. A total volume of 0.2 ml per 10 g of body weight was administered to the mouse once a day. Blood (0.5\u20130.8 ml) was withdrawn from the retro-orbital plexus of the mice and collected into Eppendorf tubes on the 8th day after fasting for 12 h. The blood was then separated using refrigerated centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 10 min to afford the serum. The serum samples and liver, spleen, and lung tissues were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis.","Extraction: Plant materials: 100 g of AR was extracted with 1000 ml of water by refluxing twice (2 h each). The combined solution was filtered, concentrated under reduced pressure, and subsequently freeze-dried. Serum and tissue samples: Liver (about 200 mg), spleen (about 100 mg), and lung (about 90 mg) tissues were extracted with 1 ml of acetonitrile\/water (1:1) using an ultrasonic cell crusher (Ningbo Scientz Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China).","Sample collection: Plant materials: Two different sample preparation procedures were used for the comprehensive chemical characterization of the AR aqueous crude extract. In the first procedure (M1), the freeze-dried powder (about 30 mg) was redissolved in KH2PO4 buffer in D2O (adjusted to pH 6.0 by 1 M NaOD) containing 0.05% TSP. The sample was then centrifuged for 10 min at 13 000 rpm. The supernatants (600 \u00b5l) of all the samples were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. In the second procedure (M2), 4 g of freeze-dried powder was suspended in 100 ml of water and partitioned by an equal volume of petroleum ether, EtOAc, and n-BuOH in sequence. The soluble fractions in petroleum ether (M2P), EtOAc (M2E), and n-BuOH (M2B) and the residual water (M2W) fractions were transferred separately into round-bottomed flasks and taken to dryness with a rotary vacuum evaporator. The M2P and M2E samples were redissolved in CDCl3 and CD3OD, respectively, whereas the M2B and M2W samples were reconstituted in KH2PO4 buffer in D2O. All the samples were transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. Serum and tissue samples: Each serum sample (300 \u00b5l) was mixed with 300 \u00b5l of D2O and centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), after which 550 \u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred into 5 mm NMR tubes for NMR analysis. The resultant liver, spleen, and lung supernatants were centrifuged (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), lyophilized in nitrogen flow, and redissolved into 600 \u00b5l of phosphate buffer (0.1 M, KH2PO4\/Na2HPO4, pH 7.4) containing 0.01% TSP and 10% D2O. After final centrifugation (13 000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C, 10 min), each supernatant (550 \u00b5l) was transferred into a 5 mm NMR tube for NMR analysis.","Nmr spec: Plant materials: The 1H NMR spectra was recorded at 25 \u00b0C on a Bruker 600 MHz AVANCE III NMR spectrometer (600.13 MHz proton frequency, Bruker BioSpin, Germany). Serum and tissue samples: The 1H NMR spectra were acquired at 298 K on a Bruker 600 MHz AVANCE III NMR spectrometer equipped with a Bruker 5 mm double resonance BBI probe.","Nmr assay: Plant materials: Each 1H NMR spectrum for M1 and M2E was acquired using the zg30 pulse sequence, which consisted of 32 scans requiring a 2.654 s acquisition time with the following parameters: spectral width of 12,345.7 Hz, spectral size of 65,536 points, pulse width (PW) of 30\u00b0, and a relaxation delay (RD) of 1.0 s. For other fractions, the zg30 pulse sequence was used for M2P, and the noesygppr1d pulse sequence was used for M2B and M2W. Serum and tissue samples: 1H NMR spectrum for M1 and M2E was acquired using the cpmgpr1d pulse sequence for serum samples and the noesygppr1d pulse sequence for tissue extracts.","Data transformation: Plant materials: The 1H NMR spectra were manually phase- and baseline-corrected and calibrated to TSP at 0.00 ppm for M1 and to methanol at 3.30 ppm for M2E using MestReNova (version 8.0.1, Mestrelab Research, Santiago de Compostella, Spain). For M1, the spectrum was divided into integrated regions of equal width (0.04 ppm) corresponding to the region of d 0.78\u20139.22. The region of d 4.66\u20135.06 was excluded from the analysis because of the residual signals of HOD. For M2E, the 1H NMR spectral region from d 0.16\u20139.76 was segmented into regions with widths of 0.04 ppm, and the two regions of d 4.68\u20135.40 and d 3.28\u20133.36 were excluded from the analysis due to the residual signal of HOD and CHD2OD. Serum and tissue samples: All spectra were manually phase- and baseline-corrected using the MestReNova software. TSP with a chemical shift at d 0.00 was used as a spectral reference for all tissue (lung, liver, spleen) extracts, whereas the NMR spectra of the serum were referenced to that of creatine at d 3.04. The regions containing the resonance from residual water (d 4.68\u20135.16) were excluded. All spectra were then segmented at 0.04 ppm intervals across d 0.72\u20137.88 for serum samples and across d 0.80\u20139.00 for tissue extract samples. Normalization to a total sum of all integrals for serum and to the tissue weights for tissue extracts were conducted before multivariate analysis.","Metabolite id: The resonances in these spectra were assigned to individual metabolites according to the literature data, NMR database such as Chenomx NMR suite software (chenomx Inc. Edmonton, AB, Canada, evaluated), HMDB (http:\/\/www.hmdb.ca\/spectra\/nmr_one_d\/search), BMRB (http:\/\/www.bmrb.wisc.edu\/), and also based on comparisons with the chemical shifts of standard compounds. For quantitative data analysis of identified metabolites, relative amount of metabolites were evaluated based on the integrated regions (buckets) from the least overlapping NMR signals of metabolites."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS189","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS189","title":"Comparison of Two Different Astragali Radix by 1H NMR based Metabolomic Approach","date":"2017-01-16","timestamp":1484524800,"submitter":["Aiping Li","Zhenyu Li"],"publications":[{"title":"Comparison of Two Different Astragali Radix by\n1H NMR based Metabolomic Approach","doi":"10.1021\/pr501167u","pubmed":"PMID:25844502"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Bruker","organism":["Mus musculus","Astragalus mongholicus"],"organism_parts":["blood serum","primary root"],"metabolites":["lipid","isoleucine","leucine","valine","hydroxybutyrate","lactate","lysine","alanine","arginine","ornithine","acetate","N-acetyl-glycoproteins","glutamate","methionine","O-acetyl-glycoproteins","glutamine","GSSG","acetoacetate","pyruvate","malate","succinate","2-ketoglutarate","citrate","hypotaurine","aspartate","dimethylamine","trimethylamine","creatine","ethanolamine","choline","glycerophosphocholine","phosphoethanolamine","TMAO","taurine","betaine","scyllo-inositol","Methyl phosphate","glycine","adenosine","glucose","mannose","glycogen","uracil","cytidine","fumarate","tyrosine","histidine","Phenylalanine","Niacinamide","uridine","xanthine","hypoxanthine","formate","dimethylglycine","triglyceride","myo-inositol","glycerol","Leucine","Isoleucine","Valine","Threonine","Alanine","Arginine","Acetic acid","proline","GABA","succinic acid","aspartic acid","asparagine","Xylose","Glucose","galactose","Sucrose","Raffinose","Fumaric acid","adenine","Formic acid","fatty acids"]}},"MTBLS148":{"description":["There is a lack of comprehensive studies documenting the impact of sample collection conditions on metabolic composition of human urine. To address this issue, two experiments were performed at a three-month interval, in which midstream urine samples from healthy individuals were collected, pooled, divided into several aliquots and kept under specific conditions (room temperature, 4 \u00b0C, with or without preservative) up to 72 h before storage at -80 \u00b0C. Samples were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry and bacterial contamination was monitored by turbidimetry. Multivariate analyses showed that urinary metabolic fingerprints were affected by the presence of preservatives and also by storage at room temperature from 24 to 72 hours, whereas no change was observed for urine samples stored at 4 \u00b0C over a 72-hour period. Investigations were then focused on 280 metabolites previously identified in urine: 19 of them were impacted by the kind of sample collection protocol in both experiments, including 12 metabolites affected by bacterial contamination and 7 exhibiting poor chemical stability. Finally, our results emphasize that the use of preservative prevents bacterial overgrowth, but does not avoid metabolite instability in solution, whereas storage at 4 \u00b0C inhibits bacterial overgrowth at least over a 72-hour period and slows the chemical degradation process. Consequently, and for further LC\/MS analyses, human urine samples should be maintained at 4 \u00b0C if their collection is performed over 24 hours.","Sample collection: Urine samples were anonymously collected from laboratory staff. Only the gender of the donor was recorded. Samples were collected on the day of the experiment between 9:30 and 10:30 a.m. (T0 = 10:30 a.m.). Two experiments were conducted with different donors over a period of 3 months, always using the same protocol. Once urine samples were pooled (to eliminate inter-individual variations), several aliquots were prepared and subjected to different collection conditions (with or without preservatives) and were stored either at room temperature (on the laboratory bench, with recorded temperatures ranging from 19 to 26 \u00b0C) or at 4 \u00b0C. Samples were collected at regular time intervals (every 4 or 12 h) between 0 and 72 h and kept at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.","Extraction: Samples for UHPLC\/HRMS analysis were centrifuged (3,000 rpm for 5 min) and then diluted in deionized water (dilution 1\/5: 20 \u00b5l of urine in 80 \u00b5l of water) prior to analysis.","Chromatography: Analyses were performed on an Accela liquid chromatographic system (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The UHPLC chromatographic separation was performed on a Hypersil GOLD C18 1.9 \u00b5m, 2.1 mm x 150 mm column (Thermo Fisher Scientific) equipped with an online prefilter (Interchim, Montlu\u00e7on, France). The mobile phases were (A) 100% water and (B) 100% acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. After an isocratic step of 2 min at 100% phase A, a linear gradient from 0% to 100% B was run over the next 11 min with a mobile phase flow of 500 \u00b5l\/min. After returning to 100% A at 15.5 min, the column was then allowed to equilibrate for 3.5 min, leading to a total run time of 19 min.","Mass spec: The LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was fitted with an electrospray source operated in the positive- and negative-ion modes. The software interface was Xcalibur (version 2.1) (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The mass spectrometer was calibrated before each analysis using a calibration solution provided by the manufacturer (external calibration). Mass spectra were recorded from 75 Th to 1,000 Th with an AGC value of 5x10^5. The mass resolution of the analyzer was set to 30,000 (m\/\u0394m, fwhm at 400 Th). The mass spectra were acquired in the reduced profile mode. In the positive-ion mode, the electrospray voltage was set to 5 kV, the capillary voltage to 8 V, and the tube lens offset to 65 V. The sheath and auxiliary gas flows (both nitrogen) were optimized at 35 and 8 arbitrary units (au), respectively, and the drying gas temperature was set to 275 \u00b0C. In the negative-ion mode, the electrospray voltage was set to -3.5 kV, and the capillary voltage and tube lens offset were set to -20 and -70 V, respectively; the sheath and auxiliary gas flows (both nitrogen) were 45 and 15 au respectively, and the drying gas temperature was 275 \u00b0C. Biological samples were randomly analyzed and a quality control sample (QC: urine pool) was injected every 10 samples to check the performance of the analytical system in terms of retention times, accurate mass measurements, and signal intensities.","Data transformation: Data processing Automatic peak detection and integration were performed using XCMS software package [1]. Raw files were preliminarily converted to netCDF format with Xconvert (Thermo Scientific, Les Ulis, France). Data were processed using XCMS version 1.14.1 running under R version 2.8.1. The R language was installed on a Dell Eight-core Intel Xeon 3.00 GHz Processor with 16 Go RAM running Linux (Centos 5.2 x86_64). The matchedFilter algorithm was used and default values were set for all parameters except for fwhm, step, steps, mzdiff, and mzwid, which were set respectively at 4, 0.01, 2, 0.01, and 0.01 (for both grouping steps). Intensity drift correction Intensities of the 4 peak lists (2 experiments x 2 ionization modes) were normalized as follows. First, for each variable, a local quadratic (loess) model representative of intensity variation along passage order was built with the values of the quality control (QC) sample [2]. Intensities were then divided by the model predictions. For the positive peak list of Exp. 2, QC values were not representative, and variable intensities were divided by their median as no obvious drift was observed. Second, peak list intensities were scaled by multiplying each of the 4 blocks by a common factor equal to the geometric mean of the block raw intensity medians. Note that this last step is only aimed at providing intensities with meaningful values (otherwise relative intensities are close to 1) and does not modify univariate statistics (since nonparametric tests are used) nor multivariate modeling (because of unit-variance scaling). Normalization resulted in a decrease from the median of the coefficient of variation (CV) of the identified variables (see below) within the QC samples in Exp. 1 (resp. Exp. 2) from 24% to 5% (resp. from 14% to 11%). The few variables that remained correlated with injection order (< 5% and 2% for Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, respectively) were discarded. Filtering Variables with a mean intensity in the QC samples less than 2 times the mean intensity in blank samples (i.e., phase A: water with 0.1% formic acid), or with a coefficient of variation in the QC samples > 30% were filtered out. Statistical analysis Univariate correlation with time storage duration was tested by using the nonparametric Spearman coefficient of rank correlation [3] and controlling the false discovery rate [4] at a 0.01 threshold. All peak intensities of the metabolites showing significant variations were confirmed by manual integration using the QuanBrowser software, in order to avoid any false-positive or false-negative deconvolution that may have been generated with XCMS. Prior to multivariate analysis, one observation from Exp. 2 with outlier distribution quantiles [5] (p=10-3 threshold) was discarded. Intensities were log10 transformed and variables were mean-centered and unit-variance scaled, prior to principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least-squares (PLS) analysis with 2 components (with the storage duration as Y response). To assess the predictive performance of each PLS-DA model, cross-validation was used to compute the diagnostic Q2 value [6]. The statistical significance of Q2 was estimated by permutation testing [7]: the Q2 value was compared to the distribution of 103 Q2 values corresponding to models built after random permutation of the response labels. Normalization, univariate and multivariate statistical analyzes were all performed using scripts coded and run in the R language and environment (R Core Team, 2013; version 3.0.2). Venn diagrams were drawn using the \"Vennerable\" package version 1.0 [8]. Ref: [1] Smith, C. A., Want, E. J., O\u2019Maille, G., Abagyan, R., & Siuzdak, G. (2006).

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed nontargeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29 \u00b1 4 y of age) and 15 elderly (81 \u00b1 7 y of age) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV = SD\/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found 14 blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, and NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in antioxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson\u2019s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. Although our CV values are mostly consistent with those CVs previously published, we here report previously unidentified CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4\u20132.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values, such as ATP and glutathione, may be related to various diseases because their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus, human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences. <\/p> Data from three injections of the same sample and three samples prepared from the same donated blood are available under accession number MTBLS263. Blood samples drawn from four volunteers four times within 24 h are available under accession number MTBLS264. Plasma and RBC data from all 30 subjects can be found under MTBLS266 and MTBLS267, respectively.","Sample collection: Blood samples for metabolomic analysis were taken from vein into a 5 ml heparin tube (Terumo). Immediately, 0.2 ml blood were quenched in 1.8 ml \u221240 \u00b0C 55% methanol. The rest of the blood sample was centrifuged at 120 x g for 15 min at room temperature to separate plasma and red blood cells. After centrifugation 0.2 ml of separated plasma and red blood cells fraction, respectively, were quenched in 1.8 ml \u221240 \u00b0C 55% methanol.","Extraction: A constant amount of two internal standards (10 nmol of HEPES, 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid, and PIPES, piperazine-N,N\u2032-bis(2-ethanesulfonic acid) was added to each sample. After brief vortexing, samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins and cell debris. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 \u03bcl (equivalent to 5 \u03bcl of initial sample) was used for each injection into the LC-MS system.","Chromatography: LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously[1]. Briefly, metabolites were separated on a ZIC-pHILIC column (Merck SeQuant, Sweden; 150 x 2.1 mm, 5 \u00b5m particle size) using acetonitrile (A) and 10 mM ammonium carbonate buffer, pH 9.3 (B) as the mobile phase, with gradient elution from 80% A to 20% A in 30 min, at a flow rate of 100 \u00b5l\/min.

The complete workflow and processing parameters are summarized in the publication.","Metabolite id: Metabolites were identified by comparing their m\/z values and retention times with authentic pure standards. If no standard was available, metabolites were assigned by analysis of MS\/MS spectra (MS\/MS), as described in the publication.

trichomes are metabolic cell factories with the capacity to produce large quantities of secondary metabolites. Little is known about the connection between central carbon metabolism and metabolic productivity for secondary metabolites in glandular trichomes. To address this gap in our knowledge, we performed comparative metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and 13C-labeling of type VI glandular trichomes and leaves from a cultivated (Solanum lycopersicum LA4024) and a wild (Solanum habrochaites LA1777) tomato accession. Specific features of glandular trichomes that drive the formation of secondary metabolites could be identified. Tomato type VI trichomes are photosynthetic but acquire their carbon essentially from leaf sucrose. The energy and reducing power from photosynthesis are used to support the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, while the comparatively reduced Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle activity may be involved in recycling metabolic CO2. Glandular trichomes cope with oxidative stress by producing high levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids, oxylipins, and glutathione. Finally, distinct mechanisms are present in glandular trichomes to increase the supply of precursors for the isoprenoid pathways. Particularly, the citrate-malate shuttle supplies cytosolic acetyl CoA and plastidic glycolysis and malic enzyme support the formation of plastidic pyruvate. A model is proposed on how glandular trichomes achieve high metabolic productivity.","Sample collection: Plant leaves were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen, producing three individual leaf pools of 6 plants, each. For trichome harvest, tomato leaves were put on the hand palm (using gloves) and trichomes were quickly brushed off the leaves by a 2 cm broad paint brush which was dipped in liquid nitrogen. Trichomes of 15 plant leaves (LA1777) and 50 plant leaves (LA4024), respectively, were pooled in a mortar filled likewise with liquid nitrogen. The quenched trichomes were further purified under liquid nitrogen conditions by sieving through steel sieves of 150 \u00b5m mesh width (Retsch, Haan, Germany). Trichome-free leaves were gently ground in a mortar likewise filled with liquid nitrogen. After removal of all liquid nitrogen during storage at -80 \u00b0C, leaves and trichomes were lyophilized over night and stored in a deep freezer until use.","Extraction: Using wall-reinforced cryo-tubes of 1.6 ml volume (Precellys Steel Kit 2.8mm, Peqlab Biotechnologie GmbH, Erlangen, Germany) filled with 5 steel beads (3 mm), 25 mg aliquots of dry leaf or trichome powder were suspended in 900 \u00b5l dichloromethane\/ethanol (-80 \u00b0C). Then, 200 \u00b5l of 50 mM aqueous ammonium acetate buffer (0 \u00b0C, pH 6.7) was added to each vial and cell rupture\/metabolite extraction was achieved by FastPrep bead beating (2 x 60 s, speed 5.5 m\/s, 1st round -80 \u00b0C, 2nd round room temperature; FastPrep24 instrument with cryo adapter, MP Biomedicals LLC, Santa Ana, CA, USA). After phase separation by centrifugation at 20,000 x g (2 min, 0 \u00b0C), 150 \u00b5l of the aqueous phase was collected and the Fastprep was repeated after adding another 150 \u00b5l of ammonium acetate. After the second centrifugation, another 200 \u00b5l aqueous phase was combined with the first extract and 600\u00a0\u00b5l of the organic phase was collected. Following, two times 500 \u00b5l tetrahydrofuran (THF) were added and the Fastprep was repeated. Each time, 450 \u00b5l THF exctract was combined with the first organic phase extract. The aqueous phase was then lyophilized and the organic phase was dried in a stream of nitrogen gas. For analysis of hydrophilic intermediates by ion pairing LC-(-)ESI-MS, lyophilized samples of the aqueous phase were dissolved in 150 \u00b5l of deionized water and filtrated over 0.2 \u00b5m PVDF (96 well, Corning, 450 x g, 5 min, 0 \u00b0C). For analysis of semi-polar intermediates in the organic phase, dried samples were dissolved in 180 \u00b5l buffer of 75% methanol and 25% water, filtrated over 0.2 \u00b5m PVDF (96 well, Corning, 450 x g, 5 min, 0 \u00b0C), and processed by RP-(+)ESI-MS and LC-(-)ESI-MS.","Chromatography: The chromatographic separation of the metabolites was done with an Aquity UPLC System (Waters). For the separation of the hydrophilic intermediates, 5 \u00b5l of the extracts were injected on a UPLC column Nucleoshell-RP18 (Macherey and Nagel, Dueren, Germany; 150 mm x 2mm x 2.7 \u00b5m) and separated by an gradient of 10 mM aqueous tributylamine (acidified with glacial acetic acid to pH 6.2; solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) as following: 0-2 min isocratic 98% A, 2-18 min linear from 98% to 64% A, 18-21 min linear from 64% to 5% A, 21-22.5 min isocratic 5% A, 22.5-22.52 min linear 5% A to 98% A, 22.52-24 min isocratic 98% A. The flow rate was set to 400 \u00b5l\/min and the column oven temperature was 40 \u00b0C. The separation of the semi-polar metabolites was done by an injection of 0.5 \u00b5l of the extracts on a Nucleoshell-RP18 UPLC column (Macherey and Nagel, Dueren, Germany; 150 mm x 2mm x 2.7 \u00b5m) running a gradient of 0.3 mM ammoniumformate (acidified with formic acid to pH 3.0, solvent A) and acetonitrile (solvent B) with the following profile: 0-2 min isocratic 95% A, 2-19 min linear from 95% to 5% A, 19-22 min isocratic 5% A, 22-22.01 min linear from 5% A to 95% A, 22.01-24 min isocratic 95% A. The flow rate was set to 400 \u00b5l\/min and the column oven temperature was 40 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: Non-targeted ion detection in LC-MS was achieved on a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer using the software Analyst 1.6 TF (Sciex, Toronto, Canada). TOF-MS1-mass features were assayed between 65-1250 Da simultaneously with an array of non-targeted QToF-MS2 scan experiments in SWATH mode. During the latter, the transmission range for precursor ions in the Q1-quadrupol is set for 20 ms to mass windows of 33 Dalton and is incremented from m\/z = 65-1250. Simultaneously, CID-fragmentation is acquired in relation to each SWATH transmission window. Thus, compromising between Q1 dwell times and MS2 spectra purity, LC-SWATH-MS\/MS measurements allow for rapid assessment of MS1 and MS2 spectra with cycle times below 1\/s. Targeted ion detection for hydrophilic metabolites by scheduled multiple reaction monitoring was applied using a Sciex 6500 QTRAP and the software Analyst 1.7 (Sciex, Toronto, Canada).","Data transformation: Untargeted peak extraction from MS1 was performed the by the software MarkerView 1.2.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

While the assimilation and respiration of POM and DOM by sponges and their abundant microbial symbiont communities have received much attention, there is virtually no information on the impact of sponge holobiont metabolism on the composition of DOM at a molecular-level. We applied untargeted and targeted metabolomics techniques to characterize DOM in seawater samples prior to entering the sponge (inhalant reef water), in samples exiting the sponge (exhalent seawater), and in samples collected just outside the reef area (off reef seawater). Samples were collected from two sponge species, Ircinia campana and Spheciospongia vesparium, on a near-shore hard bottom reef in the Florida Keys. Metabolic profiles generated from untargeted metabolomics analysis indicated that many more compounds were enhanced in the exhalent samples than in the inhalant samples. Targeted metabolomics analysis revealed differences in diversity and concentration of metabolites between exhalent and off reef seawater. For example, most of the nucleosides were enriched in the exhalent seawater, while the aromatic amino acids, caffeine and the nucleoside xanthosine were elevated in the off reef water samples. Although the metabolic profile of the exhalent seawater was unique, the impact of sponge metabolism on the overall reef DOM profile was spatially limited in our study. There were also no significant differences in the metabolic profiles of exhalent water between the two sponge species, potentially indicating that there is a characteristic DOM profile in the exhalent seawater of Caribbean sponges. Additional work is needed to determine whether the impact of sponge DOM is greater in habitats with higher sponge cover and diversity. This work provides the first insight into the molecular-level impact of sponge holobiont metabolism on reef DOM and establishes a foundation for future experimental studies addressing the influence of sponge-derived DOM on chemical and ecological processes in coral reef ecosystems.","Sample collection: Seawater samples were collected from near Long Key State Park, FL (24.8169\u00b0 N 80.8200\u00b0 W) by scuba divers (4-5 m depth). Acid-washed Nalgene syringes (100 ml) attached to 1 l FlexFoil Plus sample bags (SKC, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) via a three-way valve with Teflon tubing were used to collect ambient reef water and exhalent water from the sponge. Ambient water was collected near each sponge but away from the direction of the exhalent plume of the sponge. Exhalent water from each sponge was collected by drawing water into the syringe slowly (1 ml\/s) through tubing placed just above the osculum for Spheciospongia vesparium and just above the base of the spongeocoel for Ircinia campana. Seawater away from sponge filtration (off-reef seawater) was collected in Nalgene bottles (n=2, 1.5 l total) by hand near the surface and approximately 300 m seaward from the reef, over a mix of sand and hard substrate. The seawater was put on ice immediately upon end of the dive and was filtered through a combusted glass fiber filter (GF\/F; 0.7 \u00b5m, Whatman) and a 0.2 \u00b5m PTFE filter (Omnipore, Millipore, MA, UA) filters the same day.","Extraction: The seawater was filtered through 0.2 micron filter. The filtrate was processed using solid phase extraction (SPE) with 1 g\/6 cc PPL cartridges (BondElut, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) as described previously [1] to remove salt.

Inositol 1, 4, 5 trisphosphate (IP3R) receptor is an intracellular calcium channel known to regulate metabolism and cellular bioenergetics. Its expression is up regulated in a number of cancers. However, its linkage to metabolism in disease conditions has not been evaluated. This study was designed to determine the association if any, of these metabolites with altered expression of IP3R in breast cancer. We used 1H NMR to identify metabolites in the serum of breast cancer patients (n = 27) and performed Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction analysis for quantifying the expression of IP3R type 3 and type 2 in tissues from breast cancer patients (n = 40). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) clearly distinguished patients with high\/low IP3R expression from healthy subjects. The present study revealed high expression of IP3R type 2 and type 3 in human breast tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumorous tissue. Moreover, patients with = 2-fold increase in IP3R (high IP3R group) had significantly higher concentration of metabolic intermediates compared to those with < 2-fold increase in IP3R (low IP3R group). We observed an increase in lipoprotein content and the levels of metabolites like lactate, lysine and alanine and a decrease in the levels of pyruvate and glucose in serum of high IP3R group patients when compared to those in healthy subjects. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to show the clinical utility of metabolites. In addition to the human studies, functional relevance of IP3Rs in causing metabolic disruption was observed in MCF-7 and MDA MB-231 cells. Results from our studies bring forth the importance of metabolic (or metabolomics) profiling of serum by 1H NMR in conjunction with tissue expression studies for characterizing breast cancer patients. The results from this study provide new insights into relationship of breast cancer metabolites with IP3R.","Sample collection: Blood and tissue specimens were obtained from patients undergoing surgery at Department of Endocrine Surgery, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India. Blood was also obtained from healthy volunteers for use in metabolomics studies. The study recruited 40 breast cancer patients from whom tissue samples were obtained post-operatively. Out of these subjects only 27 blood samples were available for analysis. Tissues were collected from the tumor zone (tissue within the tumor boundary) and the normal zone (distal normal tissue at least 10 mm from the outer tumor boundary). A fraction of each tissue was fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin for routine histopathological analysis. The remaining tissue samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 \u00b0C for RNA analysis. The study also recruited 15 age matched healthy controls who volunteered to provide blood sample for the study. Serum samples obtained after centrifugation (at 3000 rpm, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min) of the blood samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent NMR experiments.","Extraction: Not applicable.","Sample collection: Serum samples were thawed just before acquiring NMR spectra and 400 \u00b5l of each sample was used for the NMR experiment.

To date, most studies focused on short-term effects of bariatric surgery on the metabolic profile and found high variation in the individual responses to surgery. The aim of this study was to identify relevant metabolic changes not only shortly after bariatric surgery (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass) but also up to one year after the intervention by using untargeted metabolomics. 132 serum samples taken from 44 patients before surgery, after hospital discharge (1\u20133 weeks after surgery) and at a 1-year follow-up during a prospective study (NCT01271062) performed at two study centers (Austria and Switzerland). The samples included 24 patients with type 2 diabetes at baseline, thereof 9 with diabetes remission after one year. The samples were analyzed by using liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS, HILIC-QExactive). Raw data was processed with XCMS and drift-corrected through quantile regression based on quality controls. 177 relevant metabolic features were selected through Random Forests and univariate testing and 36 metabolites were identified. Identified metabolites included trimethylamine-N-oxide, alanine, phenylalanine and indoxyl-sulfate which are known markers for cardiovascular risk. In addition we found a significant decrease in alanine after one year in the group of patients with diabetes remission relative to non-remission. Our analysis highlights the importance of assessing multiple points in time in subjects undergoing bariatric surgery to enable the identification of biomarkers for treatment response, cardiovascular benefit and diabetes remission. Key-findings include different trend pattern over time for various metabolites and demonstrated that short term changes should not necessarily be used to identify important long term effects of bariatric surgery.","Sample collection: Serum samples from 44 obese patients included in the study were analysed: 29 females (BMI: 44.2 \u00b1 4.9, Age: 44\u00b111) and 15 males (BMI: 45.2 \u00b1 7.1, Age: 48 \u00b1 15).

XCMS parameters were optimized by the R-package IPO45. XCMS-data processing results in a data matrix which contains peak intensities (AUCs) from the negative and positive ionization mode. The peak intensities are called metabolic features, which are a unique combination of retention-time and median m\/z ratio. The order of the serum samples was randomized for analysis to avoid time-dependent bias. To exclude system-peaks (impurities in the measurement-system, visible in blanks) as well as poorly detected metabolic features, filter steps were performed based on QCs and BLs. A quantile regression approach was applied to correct time-dependent drifts, based on QC-intensities. Therefore, the R-function quant.reg was applied in two steps to achieve the requested drift correction 46,47. First based on the QC-intensities a model was built to configure the variation in time. The 50% quantile of the QC\u2019s (y\u2019s) was estimated via nonparametric quantile regression, using regression splines depending on the sample number (x\u2019s). This procedure fit a piecewise cubic polynomial (breakpoints in the third derivative) with 16 knots (df) arranged at the 50% quantile of the x\u2019s: rq (y ~ bs ( x, df = 16), tau = 0.5). Second, another quantile regression model was estimated to attune all samples using a multiplicative correction factor based on the median intensities of the original QC-intensities.

Here, we now report that we detected N-6-methyl-deoxyadenosine (dA6m) not only in frog DNA, but also in other species including mouse and human. Our methylome analysis revealed that dA6m is widely distributed across the eukaryotic genome, is present in different cell types, but commonly depleted from gene exons. Since dA6m is a direct modification of DNA, it has the potential to generate a significant impact on different biological areas. Ultimately, our work shows that deoxycytidine modifications might not be the only ones in higher eukaryotes, suggesting that such direct DNA modifications might be more widespread than previously thought.","Sample collection: Genomic DNA isolation: Genomic DNA was isolated from different tissues and species. After homogenization of the samples (Precellys 24) and addition of phenol chloroform, and the aqueous phase was precipitated with isopropanol and sodium acetate. After 2 washes with 70% EtOH, the DNA was digested with RNAse A for at least 16 hrs at 37 \u00b0C. The DNA was subsequently treated with Proteinase K and purified using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen). To ensure removal of any RNAse, the DNA was again digested with RNAse A and Proteinase K, and repeatedly extracted with the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit. The concentration of the genomic DNA was measured using the Qubit double stranded High Sensitivity assay kit. DNA immunoprecipitation (DIP): DNA immunoprecipitaiton was prepared using the protocol from [1], with the following variations: After the isolation of genomic DNA, at least 20 \u00b5g DNA was fractionated into 100-200bp fragments using the bioruptor (Diagenode). About 1 \u00b5g or the fractionated DNA was put aside as an input control. The rest of the fragmented genomic DNA was resuspended in a 1 ml final reaction volume containing 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v\/v) Igepal CA-630 and 1.5 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l BSA. To this, at least 2.5 \u00b5g of the dA6m Ab (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202003) was added. Alternatively, the following antibodies were used: dA6m Ab* (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202011), dA6m Ab** (Synaptic Systems GmbH, m6A antibody, Cat. No. 202111), IgG (Abcam, Cat. No. ab171870). After an overnight incubation at 4 \u00b0C on a rotor, 100 \u00b5l of prewashed protein A magnetic beads were added for 2 hrs at 4 \u00b0C. Next, the supernatant was removed while Ab bound to the beads was retained using a magnet. After 5 washes with the washing buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v\/v) Igepal CA-630), the DNA bound Ab fraction was eluted. For almost all applications, the DNA was eluted from the Ab and beads with 150 \u00b5l of elution buffer that contained 10 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% (v\/v) Igepal CA-630, 6.7 mM methylated adenosine triphophate). The mixture was then incubated for 1 hr with continuous shaking at 37 \u00b0C. The supernatant was removed, and then another 150 \u00b5l of elution buffer was added to remove any unbound remaining fraction. Next, the supernatants were combined, precipitated, and used for subsequent analysis. DNA oligos: Synthetic oligos were used on dot-blots and pulldown studies.

Next, 30 \u00b5l of 0.5 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) was added, and the phosphatase reaction was continued for another hour at 37 \u00b0C. Next, 400 \u00b5l of water was added, together with silicic acid that filled the 1.7 ml Eppendorf tube to about 200 \u00b5l. After incubation for 15 min with occasional vortexing, the sample mixture was transferred onto 0.45 \u00b5m cellulose acetate filters. After centrifugation the silicic acid granules were removed. The flow through was then analyzed by UHPLC-MS\/MS.","Chromatography: Analysis of global levels of dA and dA6m was performed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Rapid Separation LC fitted with an Acquity UHPLC HSS T3 column (100 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 \u00b5m particle size). The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% aqueous formic acid (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B) at a flow rate of 300 \u00b5l\/min.

The four lines differed in mutations for genes encoding two highly homologous multi-drug resistant proteins (MRPs). The double mutant exhibited the low phytate\/emergence phenotype whereas the other three NILs, namely the two single mutants and the wild type, did not. Lipid-depleted aqueous methanol extracts were analyzed by orthogonal chromatographic separations (reversed-phase and hydrophilic interaction) in both positive and negative ionization modes. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the LC-MS data clearly separated the low phytate line from the other three, with the major metabolite differences residing in the soyasaponin composition. Group A soyasaponins containing C22-terminated acetylated glucosides were of much lower concentration in the low phytate line, which favored terminally acetylated xyloside-based soyasaponins (soyasaponin A4, A5 and A6). Differing levels of the allergen Gly m 1 were also detected.","Sample collection: Plants were grown in Blacksburg, Virginia in 2012. For each class, ten seeds from the 2011 harvest were hand planted in one row. Fully matured seeds were harvested from all plants of each row, bulked together and stored at 4 \u00b0C until analysis. The four near isogenic lines were analyzed in biological triplicates using 5 randomly selected seeds for each replicate. Seeds were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and finely ground with P14 mill (Pulverisette 14, Fritsch). The powder was then transferred to pre-weighed 15 ml tubes, weighed and stored at -80 \u00b0C.","Extraction: A subset (400 mg) of this sample powder was dried overnight on a high-vacuum line and the non-polar components were extracted using dry ethyl acetate (7 ml). The extraction procedure was repeated twice with a sequence of vortexing, sonication for 20 min and centrifugation (4000 rpm for 15 min). The supernatants were combined and concentrated to oils and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The remaining ethyl acetate was removed from the soybean powder, which was then dried on the high-vacuum line and stored at -80 \u00b0C. The polar metabolites were obtained from two 30 mg subsets of the dried lipid-depleted powders, each extracted with MeOH:0.1% aqueous HOAc (0.5 ml; 9:1, v\/v). One subset was used for reversed-phase chromatography-mass spectrometry (RP-MS) and the other for hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS). Internal standards were added to both extraction solvents, with the HILIC extracts employing 13C-labeled L-arginine (13C6, Thermo Scientific, 0.09 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l final concentration before extraction) and the RP extracts employing deuterated L-tryptophan (indole-d5, Cambridge Isotope Labs, 0.05 \u00b5g\/\u00b5l final concentration before extraction). After vortexing and sonication for 20 min, the samples were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 15 min. This extraction was repeated twice and the extracts were pooled, reduced in volume with the aid of a centrifugal concentrator under vacuum (35 \u00b0C) and subsequently taken to dryness on a high-vacuum line.","Chromatography: Analyses were performed with an Acquity I-class UPLC interfaced with Synapt G2-S HDMS (Waters) in both positive and negative ion modes.

Few studies have sought robust responses of model plants to environmental stresses, such as salinity, by altering the stress dosage or by repeating experiments in consecutive years and\/or different seasons.We mined our published and unpublished data on legume salt acclimation for robust system features at the ionomic, transcriptomic and metabolomic levels. We analysed data from the model legume Lotus japonicus, obtained through six independent, longterm, non-lethal salt stress experiments which were carried out over two consecutive years. Best possible controlled greenhouse conditions were applied and two main questions asked: how reproducible are results obtained from physiologically meaningful salinity experiments, and what degree of bias may be expected if conclusions are drawn from less well-repeated sampling. A surprisingly large fraction of the transcriptional and metabolic responses to salt stress were not reproducible between experiments. A core set of robust changes was found that was shared between experiments. Many of these robust responses were qualitatively and quantitatively conserved between different accessions of the same species, indicating that the robust responses may be a sound starting point for translational genomics.","Sample collection: Seeds of Lotus japonicus var. Gifu were germinated on agar plates containing agarified half-strength BD solution [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. Four days after imbibition, seedlings were transplanted to soil (Einheit, type null) in 10 cm pots, and irrigated with the above solution. Two salt-stress treatments were implemented: (i) gradual step acclimation to various final NaCl concentrations, or (ii) initial acclimation growth at various NaCl concentrations. The gradual acclimation started 8 days post-imbibition, and the salt concentration was increased in three steps of 4 days from 0 to 50, 100 and 150 mm NaCl. A subset of plants was kept at each salt level. Initial acclimation growth exposed plants from germination onwards to nutrient solution supplemented with 25, 50 and 75 mm NaCl. In both cases, fresh nutrient solution was prepared every 4 days. The total duration of greenhouse culture was 28 days under a 16\/8 h day\/night regime, 23 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, 55\u201365% relative humidity. Whole shoots, excluding cotyledons, were sampled in situ into liquid nitrogen in the middle of the light period. Three successive independent experiments (experiments 1, 2 and 3) were performed during the spring season. Each experiment consisted of seven sample sets: control (no salts), 50, 100, 150 (gradual step acclimatization), ia25, ia50 and ia75 (initial acclimatization). Each set had seven independent biological replicate pools of four plants, with the exception of ia75 treatment in experiments 2 and 3 where fewer replicates were available (five and four, respectively). The stress doses used in the experimental designs were not lethal within the cultivation period, and at harvest all plants were in the vegetative stage, and roots did not show nodules. Growth was estimated by determination of mean fresh weight of the pooled shoots, and soil electrical conductivity was determined on 1:2 dried soil:water extraction.

Metabolomic technologies currently facilitate acquisition of multivariate metabolic data using diverse, mostly hyphenated, chromatographic detection systems, such as GC-MS or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy or NMR-based methods. Analysis of the resulting data can be performed through a combination of non-supervised and supervised statistical methods, such as independent component analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. These methods reduce the complex data sets to information, which is relevant for the discovery of metabolic markers or for hypothesis-driven, pathway-based analysis. Plant responses to salinity involve changes in the activity of genes and proteins, which invariably lead to changes in plant metabolism. Here, we highlight a selection of recent publications in the salt stress field, and use gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of polar fractions from the plant models, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativa to demonstrate the power of metabolite profiling. We present evidence for conserved and divergent metabolic responses among these three species and conclude that a change in the balance between amino acids and organic acids may be a conserved metabolic response of plants to salt stress.","Sample collection: The metabolic profiling of A. thaliana was obtained from experiments carried out in soil under greenhouse conditions, following a gradual step-wise salt acclimation approach [1]. Seeds of A. thaliana were directly sown in soil, \u201cEinheits-Erde\u201d type 0, using 10 cm pots. Plants were irrigated with half-strength Hoagland\u2019s nutrient solution. Salt treatment was for 20 days and started four days post-imbibition. Four days after imbibition, germinated plants were transplanted to soil and irrigated with the above nutrient solution. Salt treatment started eight days post-imbibition and samples were taken after 24 days. The salt content of the nutrient solution was increased in steps, 10, 25, 50 and 75 NaCl mM. Time of each step was 4 days. A subset of plants was kept at each final salt level until harvest. Details of plant growth and salt acclimation have been reported previously [2].

The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered to all subjects at the initial peak of infection, one out of the five macaques received four additional subcurative treatments for subsequent recrudescence peaks. The experimental infection in one subject was ineffective but the macaque was followed-up for the same period of 100 days. The different clinical phases of the infection were clinically determined for each subject. Blood-stage curative doses of artemether were administered to all subjects at the end of the study.

The output of apLCMS includes retention times, m\/z features that appeared in the LCMS run, and also the ion intensities of each of these m\/z features for every sample. The data will be used for further data analysis. Files were converted to .cdf using Thermo File Converter and then to apLCMS. Quality Assurance: 1. Five standards were chosen and graphed out to view the intensity over the entire set run. The standards provide information and assurance that the plasma samples were acceptable for further analysis. 2. Total Ion intensity was used as a good indicator on whether the batch was interrupted midway or not.

The peak intensities of metabolites in urine are affected by the urine history of an individual resulting in dilution differences. This requires therefore normalization of the data to correct for such differences. Two normalization techniques are commonly applied to urine samples prior to their further statistical analysis. First, AUC normalization aims to normalize a group of signals with peaks by standardizing the area under the curve (AUC) within a sample to the median, mean or any other proper representation of the amount of dilution. The second approach uses specific end-product metabolites such as creatinine and all intensities within a sample are expressed relative to the creatinine intensity. Another way of looking at urine metabolomics data is by realizing that the ratios between peak intensities are the information-carrying features. This opens up possibilities to use another class of data analysis techniques designed to deal with such ratios: compositional data analysis. In this approach special transformations are defined to deal with the ratio problem. In essence, it comes down to using another distance measure than the Euclidian Distance that is used in the conventional analysis of metabolomics data. We will illustrate using this type of approach in combination with three-way methods (i.e. PARAFAC) to be used in cases where samples of some biological material are measured at multiple time points. Aim of the paper is to develop PARAFAC modeling of three-way metabolomics data in the context of compositional data and compare this with standard normalization techniques for the specific case of urine metabolomics data.","Sample collection: Urine samples were collected from newborns with perinatal asphyxia in five time points (7, 28, 52, 76 and 100 hr after the birth) and stored at -80 \u00b0C.

is a pragmatic approach to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in western countries. In this regard, maslinic acid (MA), a pentacyclic triterpene extracted from wax-like coatings of olives, is known to inhibit proliferation and induce apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines without affecting normal intestinal cells. The present study evaluated the chemopreventive efficacy and associated mechanisms of maslinic acid treatment on spontaneous intestinal tumorigenesis in Apc(Min\/+) mice. Twenty-two mice were randomized into 2 groups: control group and MA group, fed with a maslinic acid-supplemented diet for six weeks. MA treatment reduced total intestinal polyp formation by 45% (P<0.01). Putative molecular mechanisms associated with suppressing intestinal polyposis in Apc(Min\/+) mice were investigated by comparing microarray expression profiles of MA-treated and control mice and by analyzing the serum metabolic profile using NMR techniques. The different expression phenotype induced by MA suggested that it exerts its chemopreventive action mainly by inhibiting cell-survival signaling and inflammation. These changes eventually induce G1-phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Moreover, the metabolic changes induced by MA treatment were associated with a protective profile against intestinal tumorigenesis. These results show the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of MA against intestinal tumor development in the Apc(Min\/+) mice model, suggesting its chemopreventive potential against colorectal cancer.","Sample collection: A total of 22 male 4-week-old ApcMin\/+ mice were purchased and maintained in the animal facility at the University of Barcelona. Animal care was strictly in accordance with the European Union Regulations, and the experimental protocols were approved by the Experimental Animal Ethical Research Committee of the University of Barcelona in accordance with current regulations for animal care and use for experimental purposes. After a 7-day acclimatization period receiving the standard diet (Teklad Global 18% Protein rodent diet), animals were randomly divided into two groups of 12 and 10 mice per group (Control and maslinic acid (MA), respectively). Control mice were fed with the standard diet, and the MA-treated group was fed with the same diet supplemented with 100 mg of MA\/kg feed in order to mimic the effective concentration inhibiting colon cancer cell growth[1]. Animals were maintained for 12 h light\/dark cycles, with free access to water and food. Throughout the 6-week treatment period, animals were observed for any signs of toxicity. At the end of the 6 weeks, the animals were starved overnight and anesthetized with volatile isoflurane (ESTEVE, Barcelona, Spain) before blood samples were obtained by cardiac puncture. Immediately, blood was centrifuged at 600 x g at 4 \u00b0C for 10 min to obtain serum samples, which were frozen at -80 \u00baC until processing. After blood extraction, mice were killed by an overdose of anesthesia. Maslinic acid (MA) extract used was a white powder comprising 98% maslinic acid and 2% oleanolic acid.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades are one of the signaling modules that mediate transduction of extracellular microbial signals into appropriate cellular responses. Here, we employ a transgenic system that simulates activation of two pathogen\/stress-responsive MAPKs to study release of metabolites and proteins into root exudates. The premise is based on our previous proteomics study that suggests upregulation of secretory processes in this transgenic system. An advantage of this experimental set-up is the direct focus on MAPK-regulated processes without the confounding complications of other signaling pathways activated by exposure to microbes or microbial molecules. Using non-targeted metabolomics and proteomics studies, we show that MAPK activation can indeed drive the appearance of dipeptides, defense-related metabolites and proteins in root apoplastic fluid. However, the relative levels of other compounds in the exudates were decreased. This points to a bidirectional control of metabolite and protein release into the apoplast. The putative roles for some of the identified apoplastic metabolites and proteins are discussed with respect to possible antimicrobial\/defense or allelopathic properties. Overall, our findings demonstrate that sustained activation of MAPKs alters the composition of apoplastic root metabolites and proteins, presumably to influence the plant-microbe interactions in the rhizosphere.","Sample collection: Transgenic lines[1] with dexamethasone(DEX)-inducible expression of constitutively-active MKK5-DD (line DD55-4) or its corresponding kinase-inactive MKK5-KR variant (line KR51-6) were used.

It is mainly composed of water (95%) and several minor components such as electrolytes, proteins, and low molecular weight compounds. It consists of metabolites from drinks, foods, drugs, environmental contaminants, and bacterial by-products. As part of the ongoing human metabolome project, the human cerebrospinal fluid metabolome, the human serum metabolome, and recently the human urine metabolome have been characterized. Unlike urine, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid, saliva metabolomics have not shown much progress. Therefore, the present study aims at characterizing the human saliva metabolome. In an attempt to understand saliva metabolomics, we have undertaken comprehensive multi analytical tools based quantitative metabolomics. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy data is presented in this study.","Sample collection: Human saliva samples were collected from 16 healthy adult volunteers. Collection was done in the early morning before tooth brushing by a standard method [1] consisting of spitting into a 50 ml sterile falcon tube. To assess the effect of sampling time on concentrations of salivary metabolites, samples were also collected three times (before breakfast, 2 hr after breakfast and 2 hr after lunch) in a day. Following collections, the samples were centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10 min to remove particulate matter and the aliquots were stored in eppendorf tubes at -20 \u00b0C until analysis. The pH of each sample was measured before processing and analysis. The average pH was 7.22 \u00b1 0.64, which is within the normal range. Ref: [1] Sugimoto, M., Saruta, J., Matsuki, C., et al.

Key elements in the approach are the construction of a comprehensive metabolite library for soybean, which accelerates the steps of metabolite identification and biological interpretation of results, and bioinformatics tools for the visualization and analysis of its metabolome. The study of metabolic networks revealed that infection results in the mobilization of carbohydrates, disturbance of the amino acid pool, and activation of isoflavonoid, \u03b1-linolenate and phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathways of the plant. Components of these pathways include phytoalexins, coumarins, flavonoids, signaling molecules, and hormones, many of which exhibit antioxidant properties and bioactivity helping the plant to counterattack the pathogen's invasion. Unraveling the biochemical mechanism operating during soybean-Rhizoctonia interaction in addition to its significance towards the understanding of the plant's metabolism regulation under biotic stress, provides valuable insights with potential for applications in biotechnology, crop breeding, and agrochemical and food industries.","Sample collection: Seeds of the soybean cultivar AC Proteina (Semican, Plessisville, QC, Canada), which is susceptible to R. solani, were sterilized by immersion in ethanol (70%, v\/v) for 1 min, followed by rinsing three times in sterile distilled water. For pre-germination, seeds were placed on sterilized moistened filter paper (Whatman No 1, 11 cm diameter) in Petri plates, and kept at 24 \u00b0C in the dark. Uniformly pre-germinated seeds were planted in sterile mix of turf:perlite (1:1, v\/v) in plastic trays in the dark in a growth chamber at 22\u00b12 \u00b0C and relative humidity of 85%. Sterile water was added every second day. Seedlings were etiolated in order to provide longer lengths of hypocotyls for inoculation. They were grown for one week to approximately 15 cm height before they were gently removed and inoculated. For the production of the inoculum, starter cultures of the highly pathogenic R. solani AG4 isolate A76, provided by M. Cubeta (N. Carolina University, USA), were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for three days. Uniform and healthy one-week-old seedlings were transferred to sterile Pyrex glass trays (38 x 27 x 6 cm) on filter paper (Whatman No 1), arranged horizontally, and their roots were covered with sterile moistened cotton. For the analysis of hyphae, the fungus was grown on cellophane membrane. Inoculation was performed by sandwiching hypocotyls between two PDA strips (2 cm x 8 cm) of 3-day-old Rhizoctonia cultures or clean strips (control) in sterile environment under photosynthetically inactive black light (365 nm) on designated marked sites of the hypocotyls, 3 cm away from the roots. Trays were wrapped with plastic membrane, and returned to growth chambers for incubation at 24 \u00b0C, in the dark. The development of necrotic lesions was stereoscopically observed and plants were harvested 24 and 48 h post-inoculation, and prepared for metabolite extraction. These time points were specifically chosen in order to capture the onset of infection and the development of infection cushions. Each treatment (infected or control) was consisted of five biological replications, each obtained by pooling the hypocotyls of four seedlings. Samples (100 mg of fresh weight, fw) were harvested from the edges of necrotic lesions at 24 h and 48 h post-inoculation and corresponding portions of control seedlings. Additionally, mycelia (50 mg, fw) from 3 day old R. solani cultures were harvested. Samples were pulverized to a fine powder in a mortar with a pestle under liquid nitrogen and kept at -80 \u00baC in glass autosampler vials (2 ml) until further processing.","Extraction: 1 ml of a mixture of methanol:ethyl acetate (50:50, v\/v) was added to the pulverized samples followed by sonication in an ultrasonic bath Branson 5510 (Branson, Connecticut, USA) for 25 min. Samples were then transferred to an orbital shaker (Infors AG, Bottmingen, Switzerland) for extraction under continuous agitation (150 rpm) for 2 h at 24 \u00baC. Extracts were filtered through 0.2 \u00b5m filters (Millex-FG, Millipore, MA, USA) to remove debris and the volume of samples was adjusted to 1.0 ml. 0.5 ml of the extract was taken in a glass autosampler vial for GC\/MS. Finally, extracts were dried using a Labconco CentriVap refrigerated vacuum concentrator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO, USA) equipped with a cold trap. Methoxymation was performed by adding to the dried samples 80 \u00b5l of methoxylamine hydrochloride (20 mg\/ml in pyridine) followed by incubation at 30 \u00baC for 120 min. In a second step, silylation was performed by adding 80 \u00b5l of MSTFA (37 \u00baC for 90 min). Derivatized samples were then added to microinserters (150 \u00b5l, Fisher Scientific Company), which were placed in autosampler vials (2 ml).","Chromatography: For analyses, an Agilent 7890A GC platform (Agilent Technologies Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a 5975C series mass selective detector (MSD) and a 7693A series autosampler was employed. Samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected using a split ratio of 10:1 into a HP-5MS ultra inert (UI) capillary column (30 m x 250 \u00b5m I.D, 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness; Agilent Technologies Inc.). Helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant flow rate of 1 ml\/min. The temperature of the oven was initially 70 \u00baC stable for 5 min, followed by a 5 \u00baC\/min increase to 310 \u00baC and finally stable for 1 min. For each treatment, a quality control (QC) sample was obtained by pooling 25 \u00b5l from each of the five biological replicates (total 125 \u00b5l), and analyzed. In addition to biological replications and QC samples, technical one replication for randomly selected samples was performed per treatment. Following each sample's analysis, a blank (solvent system only) was injected to ensure that no carry over is observed between samples. Additionally, blank samples were used for the detection of possible contamination during the different experimental steps, such as material and reagent impurities and column stationary phase bleeding (for GC\/MS). For this purpose, 1.5 ml of the extraction solvent mixture was processed alongside the experimental samples and was subjected to identical handling. Results were taken into account for the detection of metabolites not related to the biological material that was analyzed, which were subsequently excluded from analyses. Additionally, the metabolic composition of fungal samples was taken into consideration, in order to remove fungal-derived metabolites that could influence the biological interpretation of results. In order to optimize the performance of analyzers, calibration was performed at the beginning of analyses following the recommended by the manufacturers' procedures and using calibration solutions. For GC\/MS, tuning of the MS detector was performed automatically using the AutoTune function of the Agilent MSD Chemstation. The DRO\/GRO Range Calibration Standard was injected every six samples in order to monitor the performance of the system and additionally, samples were spiked by adding 20 \u00b5l of ribitol solution (0.2 mg\/ml) to methanol-water (50\u201350, v\/v), which served as the internal standard.","Mass spec: For analyses, an Agilent 7890A GC platform (Agilent Technologies Inc. Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled with a 5975C series mass selective detector (MSD) and a 7693A series autosampler was employed. Electron impact (EI) at 70 eV was used. Full scan mass spectra were acquired at the mass range of 50 to 800 Da at 1 scan\/s rate with a 10.0 min solvent delay. The temperature for the ion source was set to 150 \u00baC, for the transfer line to 230 \u00baC, and for the injector to 230 \u00baC.","Data transformation: For data pre-processing (peak deconvolution, metabolite identification, and peak integration) the Agilent MSD Chemstation E.02.00.493 was used. Automatic integration was performed after optimization of the ChemStation Integrator parameters based on the total ion chromatogram (TIC). Processed chromatograms were exported to Microsoft excel for the creation of data matrices. Following retention time (RT) alignment, chromatograms were normalized to the TIC and the constructed matrix was exported to Simca P+ v.12.0.1 for the discovery of signatory metabolites and trends. To ensure the quality and validity of analyses, standard operating procedures (SOP) and quality control (QC) measures were applied throughout analyses.","Metabolite id: In order to develop a high-throughput metabolomics protocol, identification was performed following a biologically-driven approach. Central to this approach is the species-specific in-house built library for soybean composed of 1339 metabolites, which includes information on metabolite monoisotopic mass, molecular formula, biosynthetic pathways, and chemical classification. For the construction of the library, information was retrieved from the publicly available databases of SoyCyc, KEGG, EMBL-EBI, KNApSAcK, and the literature. For standardization purposes, the KEGG coding system for pathways was adapted, which enables the comprehensive grouping of pathways and is compatible with bioinformatics tools such as the pathway tools of BioCyc. For the chemical classification of metabolites, information was retrieved from the database PubChem. For GC\/MS, the guidelines of the metabolomics standards initiative (MSI) [1] were followed. Mass spectra searches were performed against the library of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) NIST 08 and for selected signatory metabolites, absolute identification was based on fragmentation patterns and retention times (RT) analyzing authentic chemical standards on the same GC\/MS system with the same analytical method [1]. In cases in which a very good fit (e.g,>90%) could be achieved, tentative identification was performed. Metabolites of non-biological origin were excluded from further analysis.

As RIC can be induced using a simple blood pressure cuff e.g. prior to revascularization, it constitutes an easily applicable, safe and low-cost intervention to limit these injuries. Although intensively investigated, the specific mechanism of this protective phenomenon remains incompletely understood. Likewise, the identity of circulating factors, presumed to be involved in the initiation of protection, is unknown. In this study, we aimed to study perturbations in the plasma metabolome following RIC and gain insight into metabolic changes by the intervention as well as to identify potential novel cardio-protective metabolites. Blood plasma samples from 10 healthy males were collected prior to and after RIC and analyzed using untargeted LC-qTOF-MS. The analysis revealed a moderate impact on the plasma metabolome following RIC. However, one metabolite, \u03b1-hydroxybutyrate (AHB), stood out as highly significantly upregulated after RIC. AHB might be a novel and more sensitive plasma-biomarker of transient tissue ischemia than lactate. Importantly, it was also found that a cell permeable AHB precursor protects cardiomyocytes from ischemia-reperfusion damage.","Sample collection: Two separate sets of blood samples were obtained from the same volunteers constituting a calibration set for data inspection and a validation set in which findings were confirmed. The two sets were collected, using an identical protocol, at least one month apart from ten healthy, lean men in the age of 18-45 yr. Inclusion criteria required that no physical activity was performed 48 h prior to sampling and that intake of drugs, alcohol, and caffeine was avoided 24 hr before this time. All samples were collected after minimum 12 hr of fasting. RIC was induced by ischemia\/reperfusion of the upper arm using the AutoRICTM device (CellAegis Devices Inc., Toronto, ON, Canada). The RIC maneuver consisted of a total of four consecutive cycles of 5 min inflation of a blood pressure cuff to above arterial systolic pressure and 5 min deflation. Blood samples (9 ml) were collected in lithium heparin tubes from the contralateral arm immediately before and after the RIC maneuver. Immediately after sample collection, plasma was recovered by centrifugation (500 x g, 5 min, 4 \u00b0C) and kept on ice until the end of sample collection. Samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis.","Extraction: Plasma samples were thawed and aliquots transferred to a clean 96-well plate in duplicates (160 \u00b5l). Ice-cold methanol (600 \u00b5l) was added to each well and the plate was shaken (1,000 rpm, 5 min, rt) and incubated (10 min, 4 \u00b0C). The supernatant was separated by centrifugation (2,000 x g, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) and transferred to glass inserts in a separate 96-well plate. Ice-cold methanol\/water (80:20) (600 \u00b5l) was added to the pellet and the extraction was repeated. Supernatants were pooled and evaporated to dryness under N2. Samples were re-suspended in Millipore water, 0.1% formic acid (160 \u00b5l), and a 10 \u00b5l aliquot of each sample was combined to obtain quality control (QC) samples, before the plate was sealed for analysis. Two samples were excluded due to errors in sample preparation giving a total of 38 samples. Samples included in the validation set were prepared in a similar manner, however only one aliquot was transferred to the 96-well plate, resulting in 20 samples.","Chromatography: For untargeted analyses, separation was performed on a Acquity UPLC I-Class system from Waters Corporation (Milford, MA, USA)using a HSS C18 column (2.1 mm x 100 mm, 1.8 \u00b5m, Waters Corporation) at 50 \u00b0C. The mobile phase consisted of Millipore water, 0.1% formic acid (A1) and acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid (B1), and a constant flow rate of 0.6 ml\/min spanned the total runtime of 15 min. A gradient elution was isocratic at 0.0-2.0 min at 0% B1, linear from 0 to 40% B1 at 2.0-6.0 min, linear from 40 to 60% B1 at 6.0-6.5 min, linear from 60 to 88% B1 at 6.5-11.0 min, linear from 88 to 100% B1 at 11.0-11.5 min, linear from 100 to 0% B1 at 11.5-12.5 min and isocratic at 0% B1 for column equilibration at 12.5-15.0 min. Data were acquired from 0.2 to 11.5 min. Samples were kept at a constant temperature of 7 \u00b0C and the injection volume was 2 \u00b5l in ESI+ mode and 10 \u00b5l in ESI- mode.","Mass spec: The Bruker maXis Impact QTOF (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) mass spectrometry instrument was operated in both positive and negative electrospray ionization mode, the capillary voltage was 4.0 kV (ESI+) and 2.5 kV (ESI-). The nebulizing gas pressure was 4 bar, and the drying gas flow and temperature were 11 l\/min and 220 \u00b0C. Scans were acquired at a rate of 4 Hz using a mass range of 50-1,000 m\/z. Calibration of the instrument was performed using sodium formate\/acetate for positive ionization mode and sodium formate for negative ionization mode and was followed by a subsequent recalibration of all samples in DataAnalysis (Bruker) to improve mass accuracy further.","Data transformation: Calibrated data were examined in DataAnalysis (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) and converted to the file mzXML format by CompassXport (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Features, described by an m\/z value, a retention time, and an area under curve, were extracted with XCMS using R project, version 3.2.0 (http:\/\/www.R-project.org). Removal of calibration scans (30 scans) was performed prior to peak detection. CAMERA was used for grouping of features and annotations of isotopes and adducts. Peak detection was performed using the CentWave algoritm with 12 ppm resolution and with a signal-to-noise threshold of 6. Retention time correction was performed with the Obiwarp algoritm. Selected peaks should be present at least in 50% of the samples of either group (before or after the RIC intervention) to be included for further analyses.","Metabolite id: In accordance with reported guidelines, features in the calibration set with CV(QC) > 30% were excluded in the further data handling, while the remaining data were transferred to SIMCA 13.0 software (Umetrics, Sweden) for multivariate data analysis. Based on variable influence on projection (VIP) scores and coefficients, an orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model was optimized by removal of features irrelevant for the separation between plasma collected before and plasma collected after the RIC stimulus. The optimized model provided VIP scores, and features were selected for identification when satisfying demands of having area under curve > 5,000 (XCMS, mean of duplicates) and 0.9 > fold change > 1.1 (pairwise comparison) as well as either p < 0.05 (paired t-test) to indicate a significant change or VIP > 1 (SIMCA) suggesting an importance in the multivariate data analysis. The paired t-test used the average of the replicate analysis results in the calibration set and the single analysis results in the validation study. Deduction of possible precursors was guided by grouping and annotations made by XCMS and CAMERA. In order to ensure the relevance of the selected features in regard to the RIC stimulus, features showing a similarly directed regulation in both calibration and validation set were considered valid, while inconsistencies discarded the features from further identification. For the validation set VIP scores (SIMCA) were deduced from an OPLS-DA model based on all features detected with CV(QC)) < 30%.

Furthermore, combining novel cellular models with molecular profiling technologies, such as metabolomics can add new insight into the molecular basis of toxicity and provide a rich source of biomarkers that are urgently required in a 21st Century approach to toxicology. We have used an NMR-based metabolic profiling approach to characterise for the first time the metabolome of the RPTEC\/TERT1 cell line, an immortalised non-tumour human renal epithelial cell line that recapitulates phenotypic characteristics that are absent in other in vitro renal cell models. RPTEC\/TERT1 cells were cultured with either the dosing vehicle (DMSO) or with exposure to one of six compounds (nifedipine, potassium bromate, monuron, D-mannitol, ochratoxin A and sodium diclofenac), several of which are known to cause renal effects. Aqueous intracellular and culture media metabolites were profiled by 1H NMR spectroscopy at 6, 24 and 72 hours of exposure to a low effect dose (IC10). We defined the metabolome of the RPTEC\/TERT1 cell line and used a principal component analysis approach to derive a panel of key metabolites, which were altered by chemical exposure. By considering only major changes (+\/- 1.5 fold change from control) across this metabolite panel we were able to show specific alterations to cellular processes associated with chemical treatment. Our findings suggest that metabolic profiling of RPTEC\/TERT1 cells can report on the effect of chemical exposure on multiple cellular pathways at low-level exposure, producing different response profiles for the different compounds tested with a greater number of major metabolic effects observed in the toxin treated cells. Importantly, compounds with established links to chronic renal toxicity produced more diverse and severe perturbations to the cellular metabolome than non-toxic compounds in this model. As these changes can be rationalised with the different pharmacological and toxicity profiles of the chemicals it is suggested that metabolic profiling in the RPTEC\/TERT1 model would be useful in investigating the mechanism of action of toxins at a low dose.","Sample collection: The human renal proximal tubular epithelial cell line, RPTEC\/TERT1 was originally obtained from the developing laboratory of Dr. Grillari-Voglauer (Institute of Applied Microbiology, BOKU-University of Natural Resources and Applied Life Sciences, Vienna). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium Nutrient Mix F12 (1:1) (Gibco) containing 2 mM L-Glutamine (Gibco), 36 ng\/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma), 10 ng\/ml recombinant human epidermal growth factor (EGF, Sigma), 50 U\/ml penicillin, 50 \u00b5g\/ml streptomycin (Gibco), 5 \u00b5g\/ml insulin, 5 \u00b5g\/ml transferrin and 5 ng\/ml selenium (ITS(Sigma)). Culture medium was replaced with fresh medium every 48 hr. Cells were maintained in 75 cm2 Costar flasks at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. For compound treatments, cells were grown to confluency and cultured for 10 days prior to experimentation. Control cells were exposed to an appropriate concentration of vehicle control (0.1% v\/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)). Cells were exposed to the indicated test compound (nifedipine (10 \u00b5M), D-mannitol (10 mM), sodium diclofenac (30 \u00b5M), monuron (200 \u00b5M), ochratoxin A (300 nM), potassium bromate (200 \u00b5M)) for 6, 24 or 72 hr. For metabolite analysis (at 6, 24 and 72 hr), 1 ml of the culture media was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf\u2122 tube, centrifuged (10,000 rpm, 5 min) to remove dead cells and stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent analysis. The remaining media was aspirated and each well was washed twice with ~1 ml of Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to remove trace media and the wash solution aspirated. The RPTEC\/TERT1 cells were harvested by the addition of 1 ml of methanol to each well (methanol quenching), scraping and transferred to an Eppendorf\u2122 tube. Each well was washed again with 1 ml of methanol and the 2 samples pooled. The pooled methanol quenched sample (2 ml) was dried under a flow of nitrogen gas at room temperature and stored at -80 \u00b0C for subsequent extraction.","Extraction: Aqueous soluble metabolites were extracted from cultured RPTEC\/TERT1 cells using a chloroform\/methanol\/water extraction method. Briefly, 300 ml of chloroform\/methanol (2:1) solution was added to each Eppendorf\u2122 tube containing the dried methanol quenched sample. The sample was then vortex mixed for 30 s, 300 ml of ultrapure water added and vortex mixed again. The sample was centrifuged (16,000 x g, 10 min) and the aqueous and organic layers removed to separate sample tubes (the organic phase was not analyzed in the present study). The extraction process was repeated for each sample and the aqueous sample pooled and left to evaporate at room temperature for ~12 hr to remove any organic solvent.","Sample collection: The aqueous extract was then freeze dried, reconstituted in 600 \u00b5l of phosphate buffer (0.2 M Na2HPO4, 0.043 M NaH2PO4, 100 \u00b5M TSP, 3 mM NaN3 in 100% D2O) and centrifuged (16,000 x g, 5 min); of which 550 \u00b5l was transferred to a standard 5 mm glass NMR tube for spectroscopic analysis. The culture media was prepared for spectroscopic analysis by the addition of 50 \u00b5l of D2O (containing 0.2% TSP (w\/v)) to 550 \u00b5l of media sample, vortex mixed and 550 \u00b5l (TSP: 0.97 mM) transferred to a standard 5 mm glass NMR tube. All reagents were checked prior to sample preparation by obtaining a 1D 1H NMR spectrum to ensure that they contain no contaminants that may interfere with the downstream spectroscopic analysis.","Nmr spec: High-resolution, 1D, 1H NMR spectra of reconstituted intracellular aqueous extracts and culture media were acquired at 14.1 T (600.13 MHz 1H frequency) using a Bruker AVANCE 600 spectrometer (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). A 5 mm broadband-inverse tube probehead held at 300 K was used for all NMR experiments. A BACS 60 automated sample changer (Bruker BioSpin) was used for sample management during the analytical run, with acquisitions controlled using Xwin-NMR\/Icon-NMR (Bruker Biospin). All spectra were acquired from randomised cellular or media samples.","Nmr assay: Following sample introduction to the probehead, gradient shimming was used to improve the magnetic field homogeneity. Carr\u2013Purcell\u2013Meiboom\u2013Gill (CPMG) 1H spectra were acquired using the pulse sequence (RD-90\u00b0-[t-1801-t]n-AQ). The fixed echo time, t was set to 400 \u00b5s, giving a total spin-echo time of 64 ms. During the acquisition period (AQ, 2.73 s), the free induction decay (FID) was recorded into 64 k data-points in the time domain, with a spectral width of 20 ppm. Typically, spectra were recorded as the sum of 128 transients following 16 dummy scans. In both cases, suppression of the water resonance centered at dH = 4.7 ppm was achieved by the application of a presaturation pulse during the relaxation delay (RD, 3 s).","Data transformation: Data were imported and manipulated in Matlab (Mathworks) using in-house software written and compiled by Dr T. M. D. Ebbels, Dr H. C. Keun, Dr J. T. Pearce, and Dr R. Cavill. Prior to Fourier transformation, all FIDs were multiplied by an exponential function equivalent to a line broadening of 0.3 Hz. 1H NMR spectra were automatically phased, baseline corrected, and referenced and normalised to the TSP resonance at d 0. For all subsequent analysis culture media data were normalised to TSP but the aqueous intracellular fraction data were normalised to the median fold change. The spectra were digitized using Matlab script developed in-house. 2 levels of data resolution were analyzed: full resolution spectra at 32,697 data points and reduced resolution spectra that comprised of 166 (intracellular fraction) and 96 (media) data points of varying ppm width. The data points in the reduced resolution data for both the intracellular and media analysis were created using a targeted binning approach.","Metabolite id: Assignment of resonances to specific metabolites was based on the Chenomx profiler in the NMR suite 6.1 software (Chenomx Inc, Alberta, Canada), on the addition of known standards to the biological samples, published literature, in-house assignment databases and statistical total correlation spectroscopy (STOCSY). After metabolite identification, manually selected regions of the full resolution spectra were integrated, where possible if a metabolite had multiple resonances they were integrated together in a single region, and unassigned resonances were also integrated. Manual integration reduces the signal multiplicity of a metabolite as multiple resonances from the same molecule can be integrated together, chemical shift can be corrected in some cases by integrating a larger spectrum width and almost all the empty regions of the spectrum are removed. Resonances that were identified as a treatment compound were removed from the analysis (both intracellular and media), as were resonances that were only present in a single batch or treatment group, were unable to be identified as a metabolite and demonstrated no time response. D-mannitol was the only dosing compound which was detectable in the study, in both the intracellular fraction and the culture media. The low concentration (IC10) of the other compounds meant that they were present at levels below the limit of detection of the 1H NMR spectroscopy we performed. For multivariate analysis the reduced resolution data were exported to SIMCA-P (Umetrics, USA). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to the reduced resolution data (intracellular and media) to reveal treatment related effects, as well as monitoring RPTEC\/TERT1 metabolic response over time (6\u201372 h) or batch (2 batches) related effects. A batch related effect was observed in both the intracellular fraction and the culture media. To correct for this batch effect all subsequent analysis was carried out separately for each batch, each batch included 3 toxins and a matched control; Batch 1: control 1, nifedipine, potassium bromate, monuron and batch 2: control 2, D-mannitol, ochratoxin A, sodium diclofenac. A time related effect was also observed in both batches over the 72 h time course of the study. Relative concentrations of media metabolites were converted to a concentration (mM) using the integrated TSP region (0.97 mM). Both the relative intracellular concentrations and media mM concentrations were expressed as change from matched control, where control concentration is equal to one, and the standard error of the mean calculated."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS9","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS9","title":"Metabolic response to low-level toxicant exposure in a novel renal tubule epithelial cell system","date":"2017-09-18","timestamp":1505689200,"submitter":["James Ellis","Timothy Ebbels"],"publications":[{"title":"Metabolic response to low-level toxicant exposure in a novel renal tubule epithelial cell system.","doi":"10.1039\/c0mb00146e","pubmed":"PMID:21103459"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Bruker","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"renal epithelial cell"}},"MTBLS92":{"description":["Changes in cellular lipid metabolism are a common feature in most solid tumors, which occur already in early stages of the tumor progression. However, it remains unclear if the tumor-specific lipid changes can be detected at the level of systemic lipid metabolism. The objective of this study was to perform comprehensive analysis of lipids in breast cancer patient serum samples. Lipidomic profiling using an established analytical platform was performed in two cohorts of breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The analyses were performed for 142 patients before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, and the results before chemotherapy were validated in an independent cohort of 194 patients. The analyses revealed that in general the tumor characteristics are not reflected in the serum samples. However, there was an association of specific triacylglycerols (TGs) in patients' response to chemotherapy. These TGs containing mainly oleic acid (C18:1) were found in lower levels in those patients showing pathologic complete response before receiving chemotherapy. Some of these TGs were also associated with estrogen receptor status and overall or disease-free survival of the patients. The results suggest that the altered serum levels of oleic acid in breast cancer patients are associated with their response to chemotherapy.","Sample collection: The samples used in our study were obtained from the neoadjuvant GeparQuattro trial, which was a multicenter, prospective, randomized Phase III trial with 1,495 patients with locally advanced, operable tumors.

In addition, all HER2-positive patients (according to local pathology) received trastuzumab. Eligibility criteria and details of the trial have been described previously [1]. The protocol was reviewed by all responsible local ethics committees and informed consent was obtained from the patients. One of the secondary endpoints of the trial was the investigation of biomarkers capable of predicting therapy response. Tissue, blood and serum were collected at baseline (BL) as well as at the time of surgery (OP). In our study, we used two cohorts of nonfasting serum samples. The global lipidomic analysis was performed for the discovery cohort comprising 142 BL and 111 OP samples, and an additional cohort of 194 BL samples was used for the validation. The blood samples were collected during several years, centrifuged immediately and stored at -20 \u00b0C at the site for no longer than month.

With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.","Sample collection: Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in a greenhouse compartment of the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO, Melle, Belgium) and were subjected to normal cultural practices [1]. When tomato plants were 29 weeks old, 108 tomato fruits were collected from 4 tomato plants during a single harvest moment. Considering the days after anthesis (DAA), the harvested tomato fruits were classified into five groups (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), representing various developmental stages. Next, from each group, 10 fruits were selected for analysis. As such, different stages of fruit development and ripening were enclosed, whereby a wide range of carotenoid concentrations and divergent phytohormone profiles were covered. Selection of these fruits was each time realized in such a way that the number of different plants and trusses, from which the fruits originated, was maximized. For each single batch of 10 fruits, at least three different plants and thus at least three different trusses were considered. The consecutive cutting, lyophilization, grinding and sieving of each individual tomato fruit resulted in a homogenous powder, which allowed representative sampling. It should be noted that from the moment that the tomato fruits were harvested, they were kept cold (-20 \u00b0C) and shielded from light in order to prevent degradation of any fruit component.

The column oven temperature was set at 30 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: High-resolution mass spectrometric analysis was carried out on an Exactive single-stage Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jos\u00e9, USA), operating at 100,000 FWHM, equipped with a heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II), operating in polarity switching mode. Ionization source working parameters are: Auxiliary gas pressure 5 au; Sweep gas pressure 2 au; Heater temperature 330 \u00b0C; Capillary temperature 220 \u00b0C; Capillary voltage 65 (-62.5) V; Tube lens voltage 75 (-100) V; Skimmer voltage 24 (-27) V. An m\/z scan range of 100 - 800 was selected and the resolution was set at 100,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1 Hz (1 scan per second). The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at the high dynamic range (3 x 10^6 ions). Instrument control and data processing were carried out by Xcalibur 2.1 software. Because of the applied full-scan operating principle of this type of mass spectrometer and the associated metabolomic screening possibilities, the phytohormone profiles of the individual tomato fruits could be defined by means of chemometric data analysis. To ensure data quality for metabolomic screening purposes, system stability during analysis was verified by using matrix-matched calibration curves [1]. These curves (6 calibration levels) were set up in early-stage tomato fruit matrix and were run at the beginning and end of the batch of samples. For each of the major hormonal classes, at least one representative was considered. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 6) were obtained: 6.25% for abscisic acid, 5.07% for N6-benzyladenine, 6.93% for epibrassinolide, 6.26% for gibberellic acid, 5.97% for jasmonic acid, 9.26% for salicylic acid, 0.77% for zeatin, and 7.43% for indol-3-acetic acid. Since these values were well below 15% [2], appropriate stability during analysis was concluded. Ref: [1] Van Meulebroek, L., Vanden Bussche, J., Steppe, K., and Vanhaecke, L. (2012).

Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels are known to induce stomatal closure. However, the current knowledge on CO2 signal transduction in stomatal guard cells is limited. Here we report metabolomic responses of Brassica napus guard cells to elevated CO2 using three hyphenated metabolomics platforms: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS); liquid chromatography (LC)-multiple reaction monitoring-MS; and ultra-high-performance LC-quadrupole time-of-flight-MS. A total of 358 metabolites from guard cells were quantified in a time-course response to elevated CO2 level. Most metabolites increased under elevated CO2, showing the most significant differences at 10 min. In addition, reactive oxygen species production increased and stomatal aperture decreased with time. Major alterations in flavonoid, organic acid, sugar, fatty acid, phenylpropanoid and amino acid metabolic pathways indicated changes in both primary and specialized metabolic pathways in guard cells. Most interestingly, the jasmonic acid (JA) biosynthesis pathway was significantly altered in the course of elevated CO2 treatment. Together with results obtained from JA biosynthesis and signaling mutants as well as CO2 signaling mutants, we discovered that CO2-induced stomatal closure is mediated by JA signaling.","Sample collection: Brassica napus var. Global seeds obtained from Sval\u00f6v Weibull AB (Sval\u00f6v, Sweden) were grown as previously described[1]. Seeds were germinated on a half-strength Murashige and Skoog[2] media prior to transferring to soil in growth chambers. Small squares (0.5 x 0.5 cm^2) of leaf pieces from 8-weeks-old B. napus plants were fixed abaxial side down onto coverslips coated with medical adhesive (Hollister, Libertyville, IL, USA). Abaxial epidermis and mesophyll layers were removed with a scalpel. After washing three times with distilled water to remove cellular debris, the coverslips were incubated with a cell-wall-digesting enzyme mixture containing 0.1% (w\/v) PVP-40 (Calbiochem, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA), 0.25% (w\/v) BSA (Research Products International, Mt Prospect, Illinois, USA), 0.7% Cellulase R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.025% Macerozyme R-10 (Yakult Honsha, Tokyo, Japan) in 55% basic solution (0.55 m sorbitol, 0.5 mm CaCl2, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm ascorbic acid, 10 \u00b5m KH2PO4, 5 mm MES-Tris, pH 5.5 adjusted with 1 m KOH) at 26 \u00b0C, 140 excursions per min for 13 min. The coverslips were then incubated with a stomatal opening buffer (10 mm KCl, 50 \u00b5m CaCl2, 10 mm MES-KOH, adjusted to pH 6.15 with 1 m KOH) under light (110 \u00b5mol\/m^2\/s) for 1 h. For elevated CO2 treatment, the open stomata were exposed continuously to 800 ppm CO2 for a period of 60 min as previously described[1]. For ROS measurement, 30 \u00b5m 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (H2DCFDA) was added to the opening buffer and incubated with epidermal peels for 40 min. After washing with opening buffer to remove excess dye, the stomata were transferred to an infusion chamber, which contained the stomatal opening buffer pre-equilibrated with 400 ppm (control) or 800 ppm CO2 (elevated CO2 treatment). All sample preparation, data acquisition, reporting of chemical analysis and metadata related to data pre-processing, pre-treatment, processing, post-processing, statistical analysis and interpretation have been performed in compliance with the MSI. Stomata from B. napus leaves were prepared as recently described[4]. All the samples were stabilized in 400 ppm CO2 (control) for 15 min before continuing in control or switching to 800 ppm CO2 (treatment) conditions[3]. The samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min on 100 \u00b5m nylon mesh. The samples were quickly frozen (~30 sec) in liquid nitrogen and then lyophilized before metabolite extraction.

Optimized detection conditions including precursor ion, product ion, declustering potential, collision energy and cell exit potential were established for 277 authentic compounds including phytohormones (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study). A reverse-phase C18 column (Agilent, Eclipse XDB-C18, 4.6 x 250 mm, 5 \u00b5m) was used for metabolite separation with 0.1% formic acid in water as solvent A and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile as solvent B. The LC gradient was initially held at 1% solvent B for 5 min, then a linear gradient was imposed from 1% B to 99.5% B over 41.5 min, followed by holding at 99.5% B for 4.5 min, and then return to 1% B. The flow rate was 0.5 ml\/min, and the total analysis time was 1 h. GC-MS: Gas chromatography-MS was performed using a Thermo Scientific ISQ\u2122 single-quadrupole system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Framingham, MA, USA). Extracted samples were derivatized as described[1]. Derivatized samples (1 \u00b5l) were injected onto a Rtx-5Sil MS, 30 m x 0.25 mm column with 10 m integrated guard column, 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Restek GmbH, Bad Homburg, Germany) in splitless mode. Helium was used as a carrier gas.

A multiple-period (segment) method was followed as previously described[1]. In brief, QQQ scans were acquired as MRM experiments with collision gas (nitrogen) set to 5 psi. Selection of Q3 masses, DP, and CE for individual MRM transitions was done as the basis of targeted EPI experiments with further DP and CE optimization. A specific set of MRM transitions were monitored for each period according to the metabolites eluted within this period. 110 and 96 MRM transitions were monitored in positive mode for the first and the third periods, respectively. For the second period, 66 MRM transitions in positive mode and 11 transitions in negative mode (for the detection of phytohormones) were detected. Each MRM transition was obtained with a 5-ms Dwell time and a 5-ms pause time, and the scan mode change was set for 700 ms. The total cycle time was 1.2, 1.6, and 1.1 s from the first period to the third period, respectively, which ensured at least 10 points were obtained for each peak.

Using the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we performed a first metabolome study with cyanobacterial cells shifted from high CO2 (5% in air) into conditions of low CO2 (LC; ambient air with 0.035% CO2). Using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 74 metabolites were reproducibly identified under different growth conditions. Shifting wild-type cells into LC conditions resulted in a global metabolic reprogramming and involved increases of, for example, 2-oxoglutarate (2OG) and phosphoenolpyruvate, and reductions of, for example, sucrose and fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. A decrease in Calvin-Benson cycle activity and increased usage of associated carbon cycling routes, including photorespiratory metabolism, was indicated by synergistic accumulation of the fumarate, malate, and 2-phosphoglycolate pools and a transient increase of 3-phosphoglycerate. The unexpected accumulation of 2OG with a concomitant decrease of glutamine pointed toward reduced nitrogen availability when cells are confronted with LC. Despite the increase in 2OG and low amino acid pools, we found a complete dephosphorylation of the PII regulatory protein at LC characteristic for nitrogen-replete conditions. Moreover, mutants with defined blocks in the photorespiratory metabolism leading to the accumulation of glycolate and glycine, respectively, exhibited features of LC-treated wild-type cells such as the changed 2OG to glutamine ratio and PII phosphorylation state already under high CO2 conditions. Thus, metabolome profiling demonstrated that acclimation to LC involves coordinated changes of carbon and interacting nitrogen metabolism. We hypothesize that Synechocystis has a temporal lag of acclimating carbon versus nitrogen metabolism with carbon leading.","Sample collection: The Glc-tolerant strain of Synechocystis served as the wild type and was obtained from Prof. Murata (National Institute for Basic Biology, Okazaki, Japan). The generation and characterization of the mutants \u0394glcD, bearing a defect in the GlcD coding gene sll0404, and \u0394gcvT, bearing a defect in gene sll0171 coding for the T-protein subunit of the Gly decarboxylase complex, have been described elsewhere [1][2]. For all experiments, axenic cultures of the cyanobacteria were grown photoautotrophically in batch cultures using 3 cm glass vessels with 5 mm glass tubes for aeration (bubbling flow rate was 5 ml\/min) and 29 \u00b0C growth temperature under continuous illumination of 130 \u00b5mol photons s-1 m-2 (warm light, Osram L58 W32\/3). For shift experiments, cells were precultivated with air enriched by 5% CO2 (HC) in BG11 medium [3], pH 7.0. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in fresh BG11 at an optical density at 750 nm (OD750) of 0.8. After 1 h cultivation under HC conditions, Ci limitation was set by transferring those exponentially growing cultures to bubbling with ambient air containing 0.035% CO2 (LC). To prove PII protein phosphorylation, cells were shifted to HC and LC conditions in BG11 medium without combined N (replacing NaNO3 by equimolar amounts of NaCl) and nitrate-containing standard BG11, respectively. Growth was monitored by measurements of the OD750. Cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 \u00b5g\/ml kanamycin or 20 \u00b5g\/ml spectinomycin. Contamination by heterotrophic bacteria was checked by spreading 0.2 ml of culture on Luria-Bertani plates. All experiments were repeated using at least three independent cell cultures.

The cell pellets on the filters were put into 2 ml Eppendorf tubes and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C. Time until metabolic inactivation by freezing was about 20 s. Thus, cells were separated from the bulk medium, but minor negligible contaminations of secreted metabolites may still have been present. Metabolites were extracted from the deep frozen cells by a premixture of 300 \u00b5l methanol (final concentration approximately 80%), 30 \u00b5l nonadeconoic acid methylester (2 mg\/ml chloroform), 30 \u00b5l of ribitol (0.2 mg\/ml), and D4-2,3,3,3-Ala (1 mg\/ml, standards in methanol).

Finally, phase separation was induced by 400 \u00b5l distilled water and the upper polar fraction retrieved by 5 min centrifugation at 14,000 rpm using an Eppendorf 5417 microcentrifuge. A total volume of 320 \u00b5l was concentrated and dried in 1.5 ml microtubes by 12 to 18 h of vacuum centrifugation.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow. The transfer line temperature is set to 250 \u00b0C and matches ion source conditions.

Peak heights were corrected by the amount of cells using OD750 and to the recovered amount of the internal standard, ribitol, to yield normalized responses. These normalized responses were used to calculate response ratios, subsequently also called relative content, compared to the respective choice of control condition. Identification of metabolite-specific mass fragments from this data matrix was manually supervised. Compounds were identified using the TargetFinder plug-in of TagFinder-Software and a reference library of mass spectra and retention indices from the collection of the Golm Metabolome Database (http:\/\/csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de\/csbdb\/gmd\/home\/gmd_sm.html; [1]). Thresholds for automated mass spectral prematching were match factor >650 and retention indices deviation <1.0%. Identifications were confirmed manually by co-chromatography of defined reference mixtures [2]. The full resulting data set of identified metabolites and respective normalized responses may be found within Supplemental Table S1. Gln determination using the above GC-TOF-MS is impaired due to chemical conversion of Gln into pyroglutamate. Residual Gln can still be used for relative quantification but may be close to detection limits, while the use of pyroglutamate gives nonselective information on the sum of Gln and pyroglutamate and may contain trace contributions from Glu. For this reason, free amino acids were extracted from frozen cyanobacterial cell pellets with 80% ethanol at 65\u00b0C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the supernatants were dried by lyophilization and redissolved in 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 6.8, containing 2.5% tetrahydrofurane.

Tear hyperosmolarity in dry eye contributes to inflammation and cell damage. Recent research efforts on dry eye have been directed towards biomarker discovery for diagnosis, response to treatment and disease mechanisms. This study employed a spontaneously immortalized normal human conjunctival cell line, IOBA-NHC as a model to investigate hyperosmotic stress-induced changes of metabolites and proteins. Global and targeted metabonomic analyses, as well as proteomic analysis were performed on IOBA-NHC cells incubated in serum-free media at 280 mOsm (control), 380 mOsm and 480 mOsm for 24 h. Twenty-one metabolites and seventy-six iTRAQ-identified proteins showed significant changes under at least one hyperosmotic stress treatment as compared to controls. SWATH-based proteomic analysis further confirmed the involvement of inflammatory pathways such as prostaglandin 2 synthesis in IOBA-NHC cells under hyperosmotic stress. This study is the first to identify glycerophosphocholine synthesis and O-linked \u03b2-N-acetylglucosamine glycosylation as key activated pathways in ocular surface cells under hyperosmotic stress. These findings extend the current knowledge in metabolite markers of dry eye and provide potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.","Sample collection: The nontransfected, spontaneously immortalized normal human conjunctival epithelial (IOBA-NHC) cells were maintained in a modified medium consisting of 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium\/Ham\u2019s F 12 culture media (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 ng\/ml of recombinant human epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen), 1 \u00b5g\/ml of bovine insulin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.1 \u00b5g\/ml of cholera toxin, (Sigma Aldrich), 0.5 \u00b5g\/ml of hydrocortisone and 1 x strength of broad spectrum antibiotic antimycotic (Invitrogen). Cells for all experiments were treated using the same procedure. Each set consisted of three sub-cultures grown to 80% confluence and adapted to Keratinocyte serum-free medium (KSFM) (Invitrogen) overnight. Treatment media were applied to cells in each set and they were incubated in parallel for 24 h. The treatment conditions were as follows: control \u2013 unadjusted KFSM media at 277 mOsm\/l, T1 and T2 \u2013 KFSM media adjusted to 377 mOsm\/l 477 and mOsm\/l respectively. Each hyperosmotic medium was prepared by the addition of 2 M NaCl prepared in PBS to commercial KFSM. Osmolarity measurements were performed using a vapour pressure osmometer (Vapro, Wescor Inc).","Extraction: 5 sets of cells were grown in 6-well plates and treated with control, T1 and T2 treatment media. Cells were washed twice with cold PBS (4 \u00b0C) and lysed by the addition of 1.5 ml of methanol maintained at -80 \u00b0C. Plates were scraped over a dry ice bath, and each lysate was transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. Lysates were vortex-mixed at 1200 rpm for 5 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 16,000 x g (4 \u00b0C). The supernatants were concentrated in a vacuum concentrator and freeze-dried subsequently.","Chromatography: Analysis was performed on a Prominence UFLC system (Shimadzu) coupled to a TripleTOF 5600 mass spectrometer (AB Sciex). A Waters T3 C18 2.1 x 100 mm, 3 \u00b5m column (Waters) was used for separation. Each sample was reconstituted in 50 \u00b5l of water and 10 \u00b5l was injected for each analysis in positive and negative ionization mode. The mobile phase for positive ionization mode was 0.1% formic acid (FA) in water (eluent A) and 0.1% FA in acetonitrile (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 90% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The mobile phase for negative ionization mode was 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in water (eluent A) and 5 mM ammonium formate and 0.05% FA in 9:1 acetonitrile\/water (eluent B). The gradient profile was 2% B from 0 to 2 min, 15% B at 8 min, 50% B at 14 min, 100% B from 18 to 20.5 min, and 2% B from 21 to 27 min. The flow rate in both chromatographic methods was 0.3 ml\/min.","Mass spec: Acquisition of MS\/MS spectra in both ionization modes was controlled by the information-dependent-acquisition (IDA) function of the Analyst TF software (AB Sciex). One TOF MS survey scan (150 ms) was followed by 25 MS\/MS scans (50 ms each). The mass range TOF-MS and MS\/MS were 50\u20131000 and 25\u20131000 m\/z respectively. The following parameters were applied: dynamic background subtraction, charge monitoring to exclude multiply charged ions and isotopes, and dynamic exclusion of former target ions for 5 s. Collision energy (CE) was ramped from 20\u201330V in MS\/MS scans.","Data transformation: MarkerView (AB Sciex) was used for peak detection and alignment of raw chromatographic data obtained from acquisition in positive and negative ionization mode respectively. One peak table comprising the mass to charge ratio (m\/z), retention time (RT) and integrated peak area of detected peaks in the analyzed samples was generated for each ionization mode. The following peak classes were excluded from subsequent analysis: i) peaks attributed to isotopes, ii) peaks with an average area that were less than 3 times the average area in blank injections and iii) peaks with a coefficient of variation greater than 80% among replicates. The samples in each peak table were normalized to their respective 90th percentile peak area sums.","Metabolite id: The m\/z values of each marker peak were queried in the METLIN metabolite database25 to obtain its putative metabolite identifications. For this step, the batch search mode was adopted, with mass accuracy set to 12 ppm. The following adducts were applied to the m\/z values of marker peaks obtained via positive ionization mode: [M+H]+, [M+NH4]+ [M+Na]+, [M+K]+, [M-H2O+H]+. Similarly, [M-H]-, [M-H2O-H]-, [M+Cl]-, [M+FA-H]- were applied to m\/z values obtained via the negative ionization mode.

Field ionization (FI) is recognized as a GC\/MS ionization method that causes fewer fragment ions, but only few studies are available on its use in saccharide analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of FI in profiling isomeric saccharides by GC\/MS and to explore its potential application in metabolome analysis, we compared EI, chemical ionization (CI), and FI spectral patterns of consecutive mono- and disaccharides derivatized with methoxamine-HCl and N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. FI produced molecular ions and fragment ions characteristic of constitutive isomeric disaccharides. All of the derivatized saccharides that originally had free anomeric OH showed methyloxime-moiety fragment ions, attributable to the cleavage between C2 and C3. Some fragment ions in FI were indicative of the position of dihexose linkages. Although EI with lowered voltage (18 V, 130 \u00b0C) produced fewer fragment ions than conventional EI (70 V, 250 \u00b0C) did, fragmentation patterns were different from those of FI. Our data show that FI is useful for distinguishing isomeric saccharides in qualitative analyses.","Sample collection: Standard samples were dissolved into MilliQ water (Millipore Co., Billerica, MA, USA) and aliquoted (50 \u00b5g mono- or di-saccharide in 100 \u00b5l MilliQ water).","Extraction: The dried aliquot by vacuum concentrator (Iwaki, Asahi techno glass) was incubated with 20 \u00b5l methoxamine-HCl (Sigma-Aldrich; M6524) solution (20 mg methoxamine-HCl in 500 \u00b5l pyridine) for 90 min at room temperature (approximately 25 \u00b0C). Then, 80 \u00b5l N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA; Sigma-Aldrich; 394866) was added and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C.","Chromatography: GC\/MS measurements were carried out on a time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometer (AccuTOF GCv 4G; JEOL, Akishima, Japan) equipped with a 7890A GC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Typical column, injector settings, and temperature programs were as follows. The injection volume was 1 \u00b5l (splitless) in EI mode. In FI mode, 2 \u00b5l was injected using splitless mode unless otherwise stated. The injector temperature was set at 230 \u00b0C. GC separation was performed on a HP-5MS capillary column (30 m x 0.32 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies) with a carrier gas (He) flow rate of 1.5 ml\/min. The oven temperature gradient for the derivatized standard saccharides was as follows. After a 4 min, 70 \u00b0C isotherm period, the oven was programmed to rise to 325 \u00b0C at a rate of 35 \u00b0C\/min, then held at 325 \u00b0C for 1 min. The temperature of the GC\/MS transfer line was set at 250 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: An EI\/FI combination ion source was used with the JEOL AccuTOF GCv 4G GC\/oaTOFMS system, which has been partially updated from the prototype described previously in [1] The ion source temperature was set at a value in the range of 130\u2013250 \u00b0C for EI, and 70\u2013220 \u00b0C for FI. Unless otherwise stated, EI voltage and current were 70 V with 300 \u00b5A and 18 V with 100 \u00b5A, respectively. For FI measurements, carbon emitters purchased from CARBOTEC (Bonn, Germany) were used; the emitter (CARBOTEC FI) consists of a 5 \u00b5m tungsten wire with a carbon microneedle coating, max current on which is 11.5 mA. Cathode voltage for FI was set at \u2013l0 kV. The emitter was refreshed with a 10 mA flush current for 30 ms in every 400 ms spectral data acquisition cycle as described previously [1]. Each emitter could be used for 80 repeated injections, at least, without any visible sign of degradation in spectral patterns or increased background signals. The recording m\/z range was 10\u20131600 in all ionization modes. Typical pressures in the ion source and mass analyzer were on the order of 10\u20134 Pa and 10\u20135 Pa, respectively, for both EI and FI modes. The micro-channel plate detector voltage was set at 1700 V for regular EI mode, 2100 V for low-voltage (18 V) EI mode, and 2100 V for FI mode.

Small molecules (<1500 Da) were measured in urine collected from 469 lung cancer patients and 536 population controls using unbiased liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Clinical putative diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers were validated by quantitation and normalized to creatinine levels at two different time points and further validated in an independent sample set, which comprises 80 cases and 78 population controls, with similar demographic and clinical characteristics when compared to the training set. Creatine riboside (IUPAC name: 2-{2-[(2R,3R,4S,5R)-3,4-dihydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-oxolan-2-yl]-1-methylcarbamimidamido}acetic acid), a novel molecule identified in this study, and N-acetylneuraminic acid (NANA), were each significantly (P <0.00001) elevated in non\u2013small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and associated with worse prognosis (hazard ratio (HR) =1.81 [P =0.0002], and 1.54 [P =0.025], respectively). Creatine riboside was the strongest classifier of lung cancer status in all and stage I\u2013II cases, important for early detection, and also associated with worse prognosis in stage I\u2013II lung cancer (HR =1.71, P =0.048). All measurements were highly reproducible with intraclass correlation coefficients ranging from 0.82 \u2013 0.99. Both metabolites were significantly (P <0.03) enriched in tumor tissue compared to adjacent non-tumor tissue (N =48), thus revealing their direct association with tumor metabolism. Creatine riboside and NANA may be robust urinary clinical metabolomic markers that are elevated in tumor tissue and associated with early lung cancer diagnosis and worse prognosis.","Sample collection: Urine samples from 469 NSCLC patients prior to treatment and 536 population controls collected from 1998 to 2007 from the greater Baltimore, Maryland, area were employed as a training set. Population controls were identified from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) lists and frequency-matched to cases by age, gender, and self reported race.","Extraction: Urine samples were diluted with an equal volume of 50% aqueous acetonitrile containing debrisoquine (ESI+ internal standard) and 4-nitrobenzoic acid (ESI- internal standard). Samples were centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to precipitate proteins.","Chromatography: A 5 \u00b5l sample was chromatographed on a 50 x 2.1 mm Acquity BEH 1.7 \u00b5m C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an Acquity UPLC system (Waters). To avoid artifacts based on sample injection order, the order was randomized. The gradient mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid (A) and acetonitrile containing 0.1% formic acid (B). A typical 10-min sample run (at 0.5ml\/ml) consisted of 0.5 min of 100% solvent A followed by a linear gradient to 80% A at 4 min, to 5% A at 8 min. After a 0.5 min wash step, the column was equilibrated to initial conditions for 1.5 min.","Mass spec: The eluent was introduced by electrospray ionization into the mass spectrometer (Waters QTOF Premier) operating in positive (ESI+) or negative (ESI-) ionization mode. The capillary and sampling cone voltages were set to 3,000 and 30 V, respectively. Source and desolvation temperatures were set to 120 \u00baC and 350 \u00baC, respectively, and the cone and desolvation gas flows were set to 50.0 and 650.0 l\/h, respectively. To maintain mass accuracy, sulfadimethoxine at a concentration of 300 pg\/\u00b5l in 50% acetonitrile was used as a lock mass and injected at a rate of 50 \u00b5l\/min. For MS scanning, data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 m\/z and for tandem MS the collision energy was ramped from 5 to 35 V.","Data transformation: In the NCI-MD cohort, chromatograms were first visually inspected using Waters MassLynx to ensure their quality and 12 samples were removed due to poor quality (e.g. undetectable spiked in control, break in signal). All subsequent data analyses were performed using R, a freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. The R package XCMS2, version 1.22.1, was utilized to extract and align peaks for all detected metabolites. Peak areas for all signals were extracted using the following criteria: ppm=25, mzdiff=-0.005, snthresh = 10, scanrange=c(1,500), peakwidth=c(5,12), prefilter=c(1,30)). Retention times were aligned using one iteration of the rector() function using the loess method, which performs smoothing of the retention time deviations for every time point in each sample. Peaks were then found using the group() function with the following parameters: bw=10, minfrac=0.1, mzwid=0.01. Next, ESI+ and ESI- signals were merged on lung cancer cases and healthy control samples that were in common between both sets (N = 1257) and signals with masses that had a ppm error larger than 50 were removed from further analysis. This filtering reduced the total number of signals from 2756 and 1804 to 1807 and 1359, for ESI+ and ESI- modes, respectively. Next, a normalization algorithm analogous to MSTUS (MS 'total useful signal')3 normalization was applied. Signals that are putative xenobiotics (e.g., acetaminophen) were removed before calculating the scaling factor using the following criteria: signals with very high abundance (> 90th percentile) in at most 100 samples and with very low abundance (<= 20th percentile) in at least 800 samples. Scaling factors, total intensity counts for each sample divided by the mean total intensity counts of all samples, were then used to normalize signal abundances. Finally, signals with variation (measured by coefficients of variation) between duplicates higher than variations between randomly selected sample pairs were removed.","Metabolite id: Identification of biomarkers was initiated by searching their high accuracy masses in METLIN and HMDB databases. If no database hits were returned, spectral interpretation of the MS\/MS product ion mass and MS3 spectra were used to generate putative structures. Metabolite identity was confirmed by comparing retention times and product ion mass spectra and by monitoring characteristic fragmentation patterns in multiple reactions monitoring (MRM) mode against those of commercially available and in-house synthesized standards."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS28","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS28","title":"Non-invasive urinary metabolomic profiling identifies diagnostic and prognostic markers in lung cancer","date":"2014-05-06","timestamp":1399330800,"submitter":["Ewy Mathe","Andrew Patterson","Majda Haznadar","Soumen Manna","Kristopher Krausz","Elise Bowman","Peter Shields","Jeffrey Idle","Philip Smith","Anami Katsuhiro","Dickran Kazandjian","Frank Gonzalez","Curtis Harris"],"publications":[{"title":"Non-invasive urinary metabolomic profiling identifies diagnostic and prognostic markers in lung cancer.","doi":"10.1158\/0008-5472.can-14-0109","pubmed":"PMID:24736543"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Xevo QTof MS (Waters)","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"urine"}},"MTBLS188":{"description":["Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry is routinely used for metabolomics experiments. In contrast to the fairly routine and automated data acquisition steps, subsequent compound annotation and identification require extensive manual analysis and thus form a major bottleneck in data interpretation.

To evaluate the algorithms, we compared the annotation of CAMERA against a manually defined annotation for a mixture of known compounds spiked into a complex matrix at different concentrations. CAMERA successfully extracted accurate masses for 89.7% and 90.3% of the annotatable compounds in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, we present a novel annotation approach that combines spectral information of data acquired in opposite ion modes to further improve the annotation rate.

In this study, we applied a nontargeted metabolomics approach based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry to comprehensively profile the characteristic metabolites of white tea. There were significant differences in the content of amino acids, catechins, dimeric catechins, flavonol and flavone glycosides, and aroma precursors in white tea compared with green and black teas that were manufactured from the same fresh tea leaves. Furthermore, the dynamic changes of the metabolites in the tea samples with various withering durations of 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 36 h were also profiled. To the best of our knowledge, this study offers the most comprehensive characterization of the metabolites and their changes in white tea.","Sample collection: Clonal tea leaves of the \u201cFuding Dabaicha\u201d variety (one bud with three leaves) were collected, and divided into 3 portions for the manufacturing of white, green, and black teas. The manufacturing process was as described below. For the sampling, one part of the tea sample was collected. The sampling was repeated six times for the manufactured teas (green, white, and black teas) and was repeated three times for the tea samples with various withering times (0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 28 h). White tea: 40 kg fresh tea leaves were withered at 30 \u00baC and a relative humidity of 47% for 36 h, and then dried at 120 \u00baC for 20 min and 80 \u00baC for 20-30 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%. Green tea: The manufacturing process of green tea was modified from a previous work. Briefly, after withering for 2 h, the tea leaves were fixed using a rotary continuous fixation machine to terminate the activities of the endogenous enzymes. Then, the leaves were rolled for 1 h before they were dried at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min and then at 80 \u00b0C for 20\u221230 min to a moisture content of approximately 5%. Black tea: The manufacturing process of black tea was modified from another previous work. After 12 h of withering at 30 \u00baC and a relative humidity of 47%, a roller was used to roll the tea leaves for 80 min. Then, the tea leaves were fermented at 30 \u00b0C with a relative humidity of 90% in an environment-controlled cabinet with a fermentation duration of 4 h, and then immediately dried to a moisture content of approximately 5% to terminate the fermentation using a hot air dryer at 120 \u00b0C for 20 min and then at 80 \u00b0C for 20\u221230 min.

The chromatographic separation of the tea metabolome was conducted on a Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 column (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 1.8 \u03bcm, Agilent Tech., Littlefalls, DE). The column was maintained at a constant temperature of 40 \u00b0C. Binary mobile phases were used for elution at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min, where solvent A was an aqueous solution containing 0.1% (v\/v) formic acid and solvent B was pure methanol. The linear gradient elution profile was as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 4 min, 15% B; 7 min, 25% B; 9 min, 32% B; 16 min, 40% B; 22 min, 55% B; 28 min, 95% B; and 30 min, 95% B. The total analysis time for one sample injection was 30 min. Four minutes were allowed for column equilibration between two consecutive injections. The injection volume was 3 \u03bcl.","Mass spec: The effluent from the column was detected using a Q-TOF mass spectrometer with a dual jet stream ESI ionization source and operated in the positive mode.

These spheroid derived cells displayed numerous hallmarks of cancer stem cells, which are chemo and radioresistant cells thought to be a significant cause of cancer recurrence and resultant mortality. Gene set enrichment analysis of expression data from the OVCAR-3 cells and the spheroid-derived putative cancer stem cells identified several metabolic pathways enriched in differentially expressed genes. Before this, there had been little previous knowledge or investigation of systems-scale metabolic differences between cancer cells and cancer stem cells, and no knowledge of such differences in ovarian cancer stem cells. To determine if there were substantial metabolic changes corresponding with these transcriptional differences, we used two-dimensional gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry to measure the metabolite profiles of the two cell lines. These two cell lines exhibited significant metabolic differences in both intracellular and extracellular metabolite measurements. Principal components analysis, an unsupervised dimensional reduction technique, showed complete separation between the two cell types based on their metabolite profiles. Pathway analysis of intracellular metabolomics data revealed close overlap with metabolic pathways identified from gene expression data, with four out of six pathways found enriched in gene-level analysis also enriched in metabolite-level analysis. Some of those pathways contained multiple metabolites that were individually statistically significantly different between the two cell lines, with one of the most broadly and consistently different pathways, arginine and proline metabolism, suggesting an interesting hypothesis about cancerous and stem-like metabolic phenotypes in this pair of cell lines. Overall, we demonstrate for the first time that metabolism in an ovarian cancer stem cell line is distinct from that of more differentiated isogenic cancer cells, supporting the potential importance of metabolism in the differences between cancer cells and cancer stem cells.","Sample collection: Samples were taken at 0 min, 15 min, 30 min, 8 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr to capture both short- and long-term metabolic profiles. For OCCs, medium was removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for extracellular analysis. Cells were then quickly washed with 1 ml PBS at 37 \u00b0C, which was aspirated off, and then 700 \u00b5l of 80:20 methanol\/water solution at -80 \u00b0C was added immediately. The plate was then incubated at -80 \u00b0C for 15 min. After incubation, remaining cellular debris were harvested using a cell scraper (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) for intracellular analysis. For OCSC cells, the media-cell mixture was transferred to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuged at 1,900 x g for 30 s at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for extracellular analysis. The cell pellet was quickly resuspended in 1 ml PBS at 37 \u00b0C and then immediately centrifuged again at 1,900 x g for 30 s at room temperature. The wash solution was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 700 \u00b5l of 80:20 methanol\/water at -80 \u00b0C. The samples were then incubated at -80 \u00b0C for 15 minutes. For both cell types, the intracellular solution was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in a cold ethanol bath and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 5 min at -4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was subsequently re-extracted twice in 100 \u00b5l of the cold 80:20 methanol\/water solution, with all supernatants being pooled. Intracellular and extracellular samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C and -20 \u00b0C, respectively, until analysis. Immediately before two dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCxGC-MS) analysis, an acetonitrile precipitation was performed on the extracellular samples to remove protein. Briefly, the extracellular samples were thawed on ice and 75 \u00b5l was removed for GCxGC-MS analysis. 150 \u00b5l of ice-cold acetonitrile was added to the sample, and the sample was vortexed for one minute. The sample was then centrifuged at 21,100 x g for 7 min, and the supernatant removed for GCxGC-MS analysis.","Extraction: Before derivatization, both intracellular and extracellular samples were dried down in a CentriVap at 40 \u00b0C until completely dry. For the intracellular samples, the volume removed was calculated based on a total of 3 x 10^5 cells at the end of derivatization. For the extracellular samples, the entire supernatant from the extracellular extraction was dried down. The samples were derivatized using the following protocol. 10 \u00b5l (extracellular) or 2.5 \u00b5l (intracellular) of 40 mg\/ml O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA) in pyridine was added to the dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 min at 30 \u00b0C. 90 \u00b5l (extracellular) or 22.5 \u00b5l (intracellular) of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was then added to the samples which were then shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 x g for 3 min and 50 \u00b5l (extracellular) or 15 \u00b5l (intracellular) of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.25 \u00b5l (extracellular) or 0.10 \u00b5l (intracellular) of a retention time standard solution consisting of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and an internal standard of nonadecanoic acid methyl ester dissolved in dimethylformamide.","Chromatography: A LECO Pegasus 4D instrument with an Aglient 7683B autosampler, Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used to analyze the samples. The instrument was controlled using ChromaTOF. A sample volume of 1 \u00b5l was injected into the split\/splitless inlet at 250 \u00b0C in splitless mode. The first column was an HP-5, 30 m long x 0.320 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and the second was an Rtx-200, 2 m long x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) with a constant flow rate of 1.00 ml\/min helium. The initial oven temperature was set to 70 \u00b0C and was held for one minute after which the temperature was increased at 10 \u00b0C\/min until reaching 315 \u00b0C with a final hold for two minutes.","Mass spec: A LECO Pegasus IV D time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used. The total MS method time was based on the GC method time with an acquisition delay of 240 s. The collection mass range was from 50 to 500 u. The acquisition rate was set to 200 spectra\/s. The detector voltage was set to 100 V above the optimized voltage with the electron energy set to -70 V. The mass defect mode was set to manual with the mass defect 0 mu\/100 u. The transfer line temperature was set to 320 \u00b0C and the ion source temperature was set to 220 \u00b0C.","Data transformation: Sample files were first analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 s, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S\/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S\/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation. Analytes were then aligned across the sample files using MetPP (http:\/\/metaopen.sourceforge.net\/metpp.html). After alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure laid out in [1]. Batch effects were removed from the intracellular data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate. Analysis of final data set was performed using MetaboAnalyst (http:\/\/metaboanalyst.ca\/).

altricial at birth. The components of bear milks and their changes with time may be uniquely adapted to nourish relatively immature neonates, protect them from pathogens, and support the maturation of neonatal digestive physiology. Serial milk samples collected from three giant pandas in early lactation were subjected to untargeted metabolite profiling and multivariate analysis. Changes in milk metabolites with time after birth were analysed by Principal Component Analysis, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and further supported by Orthogonal Partial Least Square-Discriminant Analysis, revealing three phases of milk maturation: days 1\u20136 (Phase 1), days 7\u201320 (Phase 2), and beyond day 20 (Phase 3). While the compositions of Phase 1 milks were essentially indistinguishable among individuals, divergences emerged during the second week of lactation. OPLS regression analysis positioned against the growth rate of one cub tentatively inferred a correlation with changes in the abundance of a trisaccharide, isoglobotriose, previously observed to be a major oligosaccharide in ursid milks. Three artificial milk formulae used to feed giant panda cubs were also analysed, and were found to differ markedly in component content from natural panda milk. These findings have implications for the dependence of the ontogeny of all species of bears, and potentially other members of the Carnivora and beyond, on the complexity and sequential changes in maternal provision of micrometabolites in the immediate period after birth.","Sample collection: Milk samples were collected from three captive giant pandas, \u201cLi Li\u201d (abbreviated as LL) aged 20 yrs, \u201cYuan Yuan\u201d (YY) aged 9 yrs and \u201cXiao Ya Tou\u201d (XYT) aged 6 yrs in the Chengdu Research Base of Giant Panda Breeding. In the total of 55 milk samples, 17 were collected from \u201cLi Li\u201d, 21 from \u201cYuan Yuan\u201d and 17 from \u201cXiao Ya Tou\u201d respectively. The collection dates and postpartum days with the information of individual panda mothers are detailed in Supplementary Material Table 1 (SM-T1). The samples were frozen within 2 hrs of collection and kept at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Infant formula (Enfamil) was purchased from Mead Johnson Company, LIC (No.2011503, Indiana USA). Dog milk replacer (Esbilac formula) was obtained from PetAg, New Hampshire, IL (No.IL-BLD-OO4, Illinois USA) and Panda milk replacer (research use only) was obtained from Morinyu Sunworld Co., Ltd (No. 141-0031, Tokyo Japan).","Extraction: The panda milk samples were thawed at room temperature and 50 \u00b5l of each was added into 200 \u00b5l of methanol\/acetonitrile 1:1 (v\/v), the solution was mixed and placed in an ultra-sonic bath for 20 s. The emulsion was centrifuged for 10 min at 15,000 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was transferred into a HPLC vial for LC-MS analysis. The preparation of three powdered milk samples was carried out according to their instructions and the extraction procedure was the same as above.","Chromatography: The analysis of the milk samples was carried out on an Accela 600 HPLC system combined with an Exactive (Orbitrap) mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, UK). 10 \u00b5l of each sample solution was injected onto a ZIC-pHILIC column (150 x 4.6 mm, 5 \u00b5m) obtained from HiChrom (Reading UK) with mobile phase A: 20 mM ammonium carbonate in HPLC grade water (pH 9.2) and B: HPLC grade acetonitrile. The LC and the MS conditions were same as used in our previous studies [1][2]. The samples were put into a random sequence for LC-MS analysis and the QC sample (YY-19day) was injected at the beginning, the middle and the end of the experiment respectively to monitor the stability of the instrumentation. The elution gradient was performed by decreasing the percentage of acetonitrile from 80% to 20% in 30 min followed by washing the column at 5% of acetonitrile for 5 min and finally re-equilibrating the column at 80% of B for 10 min.

For HCD-on experiments the collision energy was 25 eV for both ESI positive and negative modes.","Data transformation: The raw data was converted into mzML format by using ProteoWizard. MZMine 2.10 was used for peak extraction and alignment and the detailed procedure and the parameter settings were described in our previous study [1]. The outcome was imported into an in-house macro (written in Microsoft Excel 2010) for removing the system background signals (the maximum intensity of a signal in the samples must be 20 times higher than in the blank otherwise it will be removed) and the remaining data was exported for multivariate analysis.

","Metabolite id: Putative identification was also conducted in the macro by searching the accurate mass against our in-house database [1][2]. MS2 and MS3 fragmentation of the key components discovered in the multivariate analysis was carried out by using Collision Induced Dissociation (CID) at 35 V using a Surveyor HPLC system combined with a LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer from Thermo Fisher Scientific UK. The MS\/MS spectra obtained were compared with the published data or interpreted for further identification (SM-T2). SIMCA-P version 13.0 (Umetrics, Sweden) was used for multivariate analysis including PCA, HCA, OPLS-DA and OPLS. The data was centred and unit variance (UV) scaled for PCA and HCA but Pareto (Par) scaled for OPLS-DA and OPLS in order to generate an S-plot for visualisation of the components with significant influence in the dataset. The rate of increase in the weight of the giant panda baby was used as the single Y-variable in OPLS. It was calculated as the percentage increase in body weight in relation to the whole body weight on the previous day (SM-T3).

Diversity of these metabolites arise by conjugation of core structures with diverse chemical moieties, such as sugars in glycosylation. Active pools of phytohormones, including those involved in plant stress response are regulated by glycosylation. While, much is known about glycosylation enzymes, we know little about their regulation or coordination with other biological processes. We characterized the flavonoid pathway transcription factor, TRANSPARENT TESTA 8 (TT8) in Arabidopsis thaliana, using an integrative 'omics strategy to provide a systems level understanding of the cellular machinery used to generate metabolite diversity by glycosylation. Metabolomics analysis of loss-of-function and inducible overexpression lines of TT8 showed that it coordinates glycosylation of not only flavonoids, but also nucleotides, thus, implicating TT8 in regulating pools of activated sugars. Transcriptome and promoter network analyses revealed that TT8 regulome included sugar transporters, sugar binding and sequestration proteins, and carbohydrate active enzymes. Interestingly, TT8 also affects brassinosteroid and jasmonic acid biosynthesis by directly binding to the promoters of key genes of these two pathways. This combined effect on metabolites glycosylation and stress hormones by TT8 overexpression lead to significant increase in tolerance towards multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. Conversely, loss of TT8 leads to increased sensitivity to these stresses. Thus, TT8 is an integrator of secondary metabolism and stress response.","Sample collection: Arabidopsis thaliana plants of ecotype Wassilewskija (Ws-2) and tt8-3 (deb122) were obtained from Versailles (INRA, France). Seedlings were harvested after 6 days for metabolites extraction.","Extraction: Untargeted metabolic profiling was performed as described previously [1], with modifications (described in Supplemental Information) using two experimental platforms Agilent quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF 6540), and LTQ-Orbitrap Velos (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Metabolite extracts for four biological replicates of each line, with each replicate injected thrice as technical replicates were used in Q-TOF, while Orbitrap had three biological replicates of each line, with three technical replicates. Plant samples were snap frozen by liquid N2 and homogenized using mortar and pestle. 100 mg of homogenized samples were transferred to a 1.5 ml eppendrof tube and 0.5 ml of ice cold 80% methanol was added immediately, centrifuged twice at 4 \u00b0C, 13,500 rpm for 20 min and supernatant thus collected were used for mass spectrometry analysis.

C. elegans possess the full range of desaturases, including the delta-9 desaturases expressed by fat-5, fat-6 and fat-7. They regulate the biosynthesis of monounsaturated fatty acids, used for the synthesis of lipids including phospholipids, triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used to define the metabolome of all the possible knock-outs for the delta 9 desaturases, including for the first time intact lipids. Despite the genes having similar enzymatic roles, excellent discrimination was achievable for all single and viable double mutants highlighting the distinctive roles of fat-6 and fat-7, both expressing steroyl-CoA desaturases. The metabolomic changes extend to aqueous metabolites demonstrating the influence delta 9 desaturases have on regulating global metabolism and highlighting how comprehensive metabolomics is more discriminatory than classically used dyes for fat staining. The propagation of metabolic changes across the network of metabolism demonstrates that modification of the delta 9 desaturases places C.elegans into a catabolic state compared with wildtype controls.","Sample collection: C. elegans were grown under standard conditions on Nematode Growth Media (NGM) with HB101 as food source, at 20 \u00baC.

Metabolomic technologies currently facilitate acquisition of multivariate metabolic data using diverse, mostly hyphenated, chromatographic detection systems, such as GC-MS or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy or NMR-based methods. Analysis of the resulting data can be performed through a combination of non-supervised and supervised statistical methods, such as independent component analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. These methods reduce the complex data sets to information, which is relevant for the discovery of metabolic markers or for hypothesis-driven, pathway-based analysis. Plant responses to salinity involve changes in the activity of genes and proteins, which invariably lead to changes in plant metabolism. Here, we highlight a selection of recent publications in the salt stress field, and use gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of polar fractions from the plant models, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativa to demonstrate the power of metabolite profiling. We present evidence for conserved and divergent metabolic responses among these three species and conclude that a change in the balance between amino acids and organic acids may be a conserved metabolic response of plants to salt stress.","Sample collection: The metabolic profiling of A. thaliana was obtained from experiments carried out in soil under greenhouse conditions, following a gradual step-wise salt acclimation approach [1].

For the previous year growth, internode 1 was assigned as below the terminal bud scar, counting down the stem to internode 7.  Since trees showed different amounts of growth (number of internodes) in a given year, a continuous internode counting down from the shoot tip to the previous year's growth was not applicable. Samples in the laboratory were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to processing, which was initiated by freeze-drying to a constant weight. Twigs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently ground in a P14 mill (Pulveristette 14; Fritsch) with a 0.5 mm sieve at maximum speed (20,000 rpm) to generate a fine powder. The samples were collected in labeled, pre-weighed 1.5 ml centrifuge tubes, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried, after which the mass was recorded.","Extraction: Sample extraction was performed on 10 mg fractions using (50:50 LCMS grade MeOH:H2O, 1 ml). The tube contents were mixed by vortexing, placed in a shaker (Boekel Sci; Feasterville, PA) and incubated 200 minutes at 30 \u00b0C. The tubes were then removed, vortexed briefly and allowed to sit overnight at room temperature. The samples were then vortexed and centrifuged (13,000 x g, 5 min, RT) with the extracts (450 \u00b5l) transferred to prelabeled, ethanol-washed tubes. The samples were then concentrated via centrifugal concentration until approximately 200 \u00b5l remained and were then flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and dried overnight on high vacuum line with liquid nitrogen trap.  The resulting dried extract was then weighed to determined yield.","Chromatography: Reversed-phase Separations. The extract was reconstituted with 50 nM acetaminophen (internal standard) in 0.1% aq. formic acid:acetonitrile (9:1, v\/v) with the volume based upon the weight of the dried extract (100 \u00b5l\/mg dry extract). Dissolution was aided by vortexing followed by sonication (10 min). The samples were then centrifuged (13,000 x g; 10 min; RT) and an aliquot was removed (100 \u00b5l) making sure not to disturb any precipitate. The sample was further diluted (10x) with 50 nM acetaminophen in 0.1% formic acid:acetonitrile (9:1, v\/v) and transferred to a LC-MS grade autosampler vial. A \"MasterMix\" was constructed from a single representative sample from each class. This sample is used to equilibrate the LC-MS system and is also used for statistical validation. Metabolite separations were performed with an UPLC (Waters I-Class) equipped with a BEH C18 column (1.7 \u00b5m; 2.1 mm \u00d7 50 mm; Waters). The mobile phases were water with 0.1% formic acid (Solvent A) and acetonitrile (Solvent B) at 200 ul\/min. The separation initially started with 95% A (0-1 min) with a linear ramp to 85% A (1.0-1.5 min), followed by a second ramp to 40% A (1.5-6.9 min). The gradient was rapidly ramped to 10% A (6.9-7.0 min) where it was held for 0.5 min (7.0-7.5 min). Re-equilibration involved ramping back to 95% A (7.5-8.0 min) and holding at 95% A for 2 min (8.0-10.0 min). Injection volumes were 1 ul, the column temperature was 40 \u00b0C, with the autosampler maintained at 8 \u00b0C. Under these conditions acetaminophen elutes at 2.07 min (m\/z = 152.0708 in positive mode and m\/z = 150.0556 in negative mode).

Unfortunately, the quantitative analysis of metabolic samples is often hampered by peak overlap. Two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy offers a promising alternative and quantitative results can be obtained provided that a calibration approach is employed. However, the duration of 2D NMR experiments is barely compatible with the metabolomic study of a large number of samples. This drawback can be circumvented by relying on \u201cultrafast\u201d experiments capable of recording 2D spectra in a single-scan. While such experiments are not sensitive enough to match the concentrations of metabolic samples, a compromise can be reached by hybrid strategies capable of recording 2D NMR spectra of extracts in a few minutes only. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that these multi-scan single-shot experiments can be successfully applied to the absolute quantification of major metabolites in plant extracts. Fast COSY experiments are recorded in 5 min on tomato fruit pericarp extracts at different stages of development. The concentration of eight major metabolites is determined with a trueness better than 10 % and a technical repeatability of a few percent. The experiments performed at two magnetic fields lead to similar quantitative results, in coherence with the metabolism of tomato fruit. The results show that fast 2D NMR methods form a promising tool for fast targeted metabolomics, and open promising perspective towards the automated and high-throughput quantitative analysis of large groups of plant and other samples for metabolomics and for the modelling of metabolism.","Sample collection: Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv Moneymaker) were grown in a glass greenhouse in South-West of France in optimal commercial conditions as described previously [1]. The fruit were harvested at four different stages of development: 8, 21, 34 and 55 days post anthesis (DPA) on three different trusses (truss 5, 6, and 7). Eight DPA corresponds to the cell division stage, 21 DPA to the cell expansion stage, 34 DPA to the transition between cell expansion and ripening and 55 DPA to red-ripe fruit. Each biological replicate was made up of 4\u20135 fruits harvested on different plants. Three biological replicates, corresponding to the three different trusses, were used for each stage of the development. A quarter of the fruit pericarp from the equatorial zone was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fruit pericarp samples were ground in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until freeze-drying. An aliquot of fresh frozen powder was lyophilized and used for NMR analyses.

Plant Physiology, 164, 1204\u20131221. doi: 10.1104\/pp.113.231241. PMID:24474652 ","Extraction: Each extract was prepared from 40 mg (2 aliquots of 20 mg each) of lyophilized powder using a robotised Starlet platform (Hamilton, Villebon sur Yvette, France). The metabolic extraction was performed in four steps. After weighing 20 mg, 300 \u00b5l of EtOH\/water (80\/20, v\/v) solution were added to each sample in a 1.1 ml Micronics tube, then the mixture was checked and put in a hot water bath at 80 \u00b0C during 10 min and finally placed in a centrifuge at 4,000 x g during 5 min. The supernatant was transferred into a 1.4 ml Micronics tube. The 1.1 ml Micronics tube containing the pellet was submitted to three other extraction steps: same solvent mixture, then EtOH\/water (50\/50, v\/v), and pure Milli-Q water for the last step. The supernatants from the two aliquots and four steps were combined and evaporated to dryness using a vacuum evaporator (SpeedVac Savant, Asheville, USA). The dried extracts were titrated with KOD to pH 6 using a titration unit BTpH (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany) in 200 mM potassium phosphate buffer solution in D2O containing 2 mM EDTA. Then, trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3-2H4] propionate sodium salt (TSP, 0.01% final concentration for chemical shift calibration) was added. Titrated extracts were frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized during 12 h.","Sample collection: Just before the NMR acquisition, 600 \u00b5l of deuterium oxide (D2O; 99.90%D, Eurisotop, Saint Aubin, France) containing sodium azide (NaN3, 3.85 mM final concentration, in order to avoid bacterial contamination) were added to the dried titrated extracts, and the solubilized titrated extract was transferred into a 5 mm NMR Wilmad LabGlass tube of 7 inches (Wilmad, Vineland, USA).","Nmr spec: All the NMR spectra of the tomato fruit extract samples were recorded three times at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III HD 700 spectrometer operating at a frequency of 700.13 MHz with an inverse 1H\/13C\/15N\/2H cryogenically cooled probe.","Nmr assay: For each experiment, the 90\u00b0 pulse width was carefully calibrated and the water signal at 4.7 ppm was presaturated by continuous irradiation during the recovery delay. All experiments by ultrafast NMR were performed under partial saturation conditions, with TR = 5 s. All the ultrafast COSY experiments were recorded using the pulse sequence described previously [1], including the possibility to perform interleaved acquisitions. The final spectral width was 5 ppm (F2) x 5.4 ppm (F1) at 700 MHz. The experiment duration is given by Ta = NS\u2022N1 where NS is the number of scans and N1 the number of interleaved acquisitions. For the experiments performed at 700 MHz, the following parameters were used: NS = 16 and N1 = 4. Due to high magnetic field, interleaving was required to sample the same spectral width as on a 500 MHz spectrometer. The experiment duration was kept constant by reducing the number of scans thanks to the highest sensitivity of the 700 MHz spectrometer. All the experiments were eventually performed with a ca. 5 min overall duration. For all the experiments, the spatial encoding was performed with two successive smoothed chirp pulses (60 kHz, 15 ms) applied together with 8.3 G\/cm bipolar spatial encoding gradients. The mixing period included opposite coherence-selection gradients (sin shape; 58.5 G\/cm, 0.8 ms). For the acquisition, 128 acquisition gradient pairs were applied, with the following amplitude and duration: 58.5 G\/cm and 256 \u00b5s. The amplitude and duration of the pre-acquisition gradient were adapted to center the chemical shift range of interest in the middle of the detection window in the spatially encoded dimension.

PMID:24322368 ","Data transformation: Before Fourier Transformation, 2D FIDs were weighed with apodization functions leading to the optimum sensitivity for the relevant peaks. A sinebell function was applied in the conventional dimension of all the experiments. In the ultrafast dimension, an apodization was performed in the spatial dimension with optimized gaussian apodization functions designed according to a recently described procedure [1]. The conventional spectra were zero-filled in both dimensions and the ultrafast spectra were zero-filled in the conventional dimension. All the spectra were processed in the magnitude mode. Finally, a second order automatic baseline correction was applied in the two dimensions of the 2D spectra.The specific processing for the ultrafast spectra (as described in [2]) was performed using a home-written routine in TopSpin (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany.

PMID:15369377 ","Metabolite id: Eight major polar compounds of tomato flesh, belonging to several metabolite families and implicated in fruit growth and quality, were selected for quantification. After annotation, the most isolated peak was selected for each compound. The peak volumes were measured using the 2D integration tool in TopSpin 3.1 (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). The integration region limits were optimized for each peak of interest on the highest concentrated mixture. Integration regions were centered on the peak of interest and their size was chosen as large as possible to integrate the whole peak but small enough to avoid overlap with neighbouring peaks. Identical integration regions were used for all the samples. To evaluate the repeatability of the NMR quantification procedure, each spectrum (calibration and biological extracts) was acquired three successive times, and average values were calculated for each peak volume. Calibration curves were then fitted by the linear regression equation: V = a\u2022[m] + b, where V represents the 2D peak volume (arbitrary unit, a.u.) and [m] is the concentration (in millimoles per litre) of the given metabolite in the calibration sample. To determine the unknown concentration of the eight metabolites in the twelve tomato pericarp extracts, the volume of each target peak was measured with the same integration file as for the calibration samples, and the concentration was determined using the linear regression equation of the corresponding metabolite.

host physiology, health and disease, we lack understanding of the complex interplay between host genetics and early life environment on the microbial and metabolic composition of the gut. We used the genetically diverse Collaborative Cross mouse system to discover that early life history impacts the microbiome composition, whereas dietary changes have only a moderate effect. By contrast, the gut metabolome was shaped mostly by diet, with specific non-dietary metabolites explained by microbial metabolism. Quantitative trait analysis identified mouse genetic trait loci (QTL) that impact the abundances of specific microbes. Human orthologues of genes in the mouse QTL are implicated in gastrointestinal cancer. Additionally, genes located in mouse QTL for Lactobacillales abundance are implicated in arthritis, rheumatic disease and diabetes. Furthermore, Lactobacillales abundance was predictive of higher host T-helper cell counts, suggesting an important link between Lactobacillales and host adaptive immunity. Correlations between specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and B-cell counts, body weight and neuromuscular function (rotarod performance) were also observed. This study is the first to determine and rank the complex contributions of built environment, host genetics and diet in shaping gut microbial and metabolite composition, host fitness and behavior.","Sample collection: Collaborative Cross (CC) mouse strains were obtained from UNC Chapel Hill and handled under an approved IACUC protocol. For each of 30 strains, two males and two females were housed separately and maintained on PicoLab Rodent Diet 20 (5053). All mice were maintained on the same water and food sources. Fecal samples were collected from each strain at 12 weeks of age. Mice from the same 30 CC strains were then transferred to a LBNL to investigate the stability of the gut microbiome in response to a new environment. Fecal samples were collected from each cage 24 hrs after cage change at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after arrival at LBNL. Fecal samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C for downstream metabolite and microbial analyses. Genotyping data for all CC mice was obtained from UNC (http:\/\/csbio.unc.edu\/CCstatus\/index.py).","Extraction: Metabolites were extracted from mouse fecal samples taken 12 weeks after birth and 8 weeks after transfer to LBNL using a methanol\/sonication method. Briefly, portions of the homogenized samples were weighed and extracted with cold (-20 \u00b0C) methanol proportionally (1 ml solvent per 100 mg homogenate) in a microcentrifuge tube. The average weight of the homogenized fecal samples was 69.3 \u00b1 26.3 mg (mean \u00b1 standard deviation). 100 \u00b5l of each methanol extract was transferred to glass vials and dried in a speed-vac concentrator (Labconco CentriVap Benchtop Vacuum Concentrator; Kansas City, MO). Dried metabolite extracts were chemically derivatized using a modified version of the protocol used to create FiehnLib. Briefly, dried metabolite extracts were dried again to remove any residual water if they had been stored at -80 \u00b0C. To protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric isomers, 20 \u00b5l of methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg\/ml) was added to each sample, followed by vortexing for 30 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with generous shaking (1000 rpm) for 90 min. At this point, the sample vials were inverted one time to capture any condensation of solvent at the cap surface, followed by a brief centrifugation at 1000 x g for 1 min. To derivatize hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms, 80 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1 % trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) were then added to each vial, followed by vortexing for 10 s and incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking (1000 rpm) for 30 min. Again, the sample vials were inverted one time, followed by centrifugation at 1000 x g for 5 min.","Chromatography: A HP-5MS column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies, Inc) was used for untargeted metabolomics analyses. The sample injection mode was splitless, and 1 \u00b5l of each sample was injected. The injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis.","Mass spec: An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc; Santa Clara, CA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each Experiment. The GC oven was held at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min after injection, and the temperature was then increased to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 \u00b0C. The helium gas flow rates for each Experiment were determined by the Agilent Retention Time Locking function based on analysis of deuterated myristic acid and were in the range of 0.45-0.5 ml\/min. Data were collected over the mass range 50 - 550 m\/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.","Data transformation: Agilent .D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector.","Metabolite id: GC-MS raw data files were processed using the Metabolite Detector software, version 2.5 beta. Retention indices (RI) of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution. Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites (Level 2 identifications). The three most abundant fragment ions in the spectra of each identified metabolite were automatically determined by Metabolite Detector, and their summed abundances were integrated across the GC elution profile; fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m\/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS345","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS345","title":"Influence of early life exposure, host genetics and diet on the mouse gut microbiome and metabolome","date":"2016-10-05","timestamp":1475622000,"submitter":["Tom Metz"],"publications":[{"title":"Influence of early life exposure, host genetics and diet on the mouse gut microbiome and metabolome.","doi":"10.1038\/nmicrobiol.2016.221","pubmed":"PMID:27892936"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"5975C Series GC\/MSD (Agilent)","organism":["Food","Mus musculus"],"organism_parts":["mixture","feces"],"metabolites":["1,4-D-xylobiose","11-eicosenoic acid","1-hexadecanol, (cetyl alcohol)","1-monopalmitin","1-O-octadecylglycerol","24-ethylcoprostanol","2-hydroxy,4-methylpentanoic acid","2-hydroxybutyric acid","2-hydroxyglutaric acid","2-hydroxypyridine","3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid","3-aminoisobutyric acid","3-hydroxybutyric acid","3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid","3-hydroxypyridine","3-methyl-2-oxobutanoic acid","4-guanidinobutyric acid","4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid","5-aminovaleric acid","5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic acid","6-deoxy-D-glucose","adenine","allo-inositol","alpha-hydroxyisovaleric acid","alpha-tocopherol","arachidic acid","behenic acid","benzoic acid","B-sitosterol","campesterol","capric acid","carbonate ion","cellobiose","cholesterol","coprostan-3-ol","creatinine","D-arabinose","D-galactose","D-glucose","DL-dihydrosphingosine","D-lyxosylamine","D-malic acid","D-mannitol","D-mannose","D-sphingosine","D-threitol","D-xylose","fructose","fucose","glyceric acid","glycerol","glycerol 3-phosphate","glycine","glycolic acid","heptadecanoic acid","hydrocinnamic acid","hydroxy-L-proline","hypoxanthine","L-(+) lactic acid","L-alanine","L-cysteine","L-glutamic acid","L-homoserine","linoleic acid","L-isoleucine","L-leucine","L-lysine","L-methionine","L-ornithine","L-proline","L-pyroglutamic acid","L-serine","L-threonine","L-valine","maltose","methyl linolenate","methyl oleate","methyl stearate","myo-inositol","myristic acid","N-acetyl-D-mannosamine","nicotinic acid","oleic acid","O-phosphocolamine","palmitic acid","palmitoleic acid","pantothenic acid","pentadecanol","phytosphingosine","pipecolic acid","porphine","pseudouridine","pyruvic acid","ribose","sebacic acid","sophorose","stearic acid","stigmasterol","succinic acid","sucrose","thymine","uracil","urea","L-tryptophan","L-tyrosine","fumaric acid","L-glutamine","4-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzoic acid","N-acetyl-D-glucosamine","1-methyl nicotinamide","1-methylhydantoin","3,4,5-trihydroxypentanoic acid","3-hydroxycholanic acid","aconitic acid","adenosine","alpha-tocopherol acetate","arabitol","beta-alanine","beta-sitosterol","citric acid","cycloleucine","docosahexaenoic acid","D-sorbitol","D-xylulose","ethanolamine","galactinol","galactonic acid","glucosylglycerol","inosine","lactose","L-asparagine","L-methionine sulfoxide","L-phenylalanine","L-threonic acid","malonic acid","oleonitrile","palatinose","phosphoric acid","propylene glycol","quinic acid","raffinose","ribitol","ribonic acid","salicylic acid","scyllo-inositol","shikimic acid","stearonitrile","tagatose","xylitol"]}},"MTBLS237":{"description":["This study employs spectroscopy-based metabolic profiling of fecal extracts from healthy subjects and patients with active or inactive ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD) to substantiate the potential use of spectroscopy as a non-invasive diagnostic tool and to characterize the fecal metabolome in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Stool samples from 113 individuals (UC 48, CD 44, controls 21) were analyzed by 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (Bruker 600 MHz, Bruker BioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis using SIMCA-P plus 12 and MATLAB. Significant differences were found in the metabolic profiles making it possible to differentiate between active IBD and controls and between UC and CD. The metabolites holding differential power primarily belonged to a range of amino acids, microbiota-related short chain fatty acids, and lactate suggestive of an inflammation-driven malabsorption and dysbiosis of the normal bacterial ecology. However, removal of patients with intestinal surgery and anti-TNF-alpha antibody treatment eliminated the discriminative power regarding UC versus CD. This study consequently demonstrates that 1H NMR spectroscopy of fecal extracts is a potential non-invasive diagnostic tool and able to characterize the inflammation-driven changes in the metabolic profiles related to malabsorption and dysbiosis. Intestinal surgery and medication are to be accounted for in future studies, as it seems to be factors of importance in the discriminative process.","Sample collection: All patients participated in this study in confirmation with the principals outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki and with the approval of the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Copenhagen Capital Region (22 054\/H-C-2009-037).

","Extraction: Fecal water was extracted by taking a weighed sample of thawed stool material and adding 2 volumes (w\/v) of sterile phosphate buffered saline (PBS 1.9 mM Na2HPO4, 8.1 mM NaH2PO4, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). The mixture was homogenized by vortexing vigorously for 1 min. The fecal slurry was centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 min, and the supernatant was filtered through a syringe with a needle (0.40 \u00d7 25 mm). The filtrate was centrifuged at 14,000 x g for 30 min, and the supernatant filtered through a Whatman 25 mm GD\/X PES sterile syringe filter (pore size 0.2 \u00b5m). The filtered fecal water was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until subsequent analysis.","Sample collection: The fecal extracts were finally prepared by mixing 4 \u00b5l of D2O\/500 \u00b5M TSP (3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuterosodium propionate, final TSP = 50 \u00b5M) with 40 \u00b5l of fecal extract in a 96-hole shallow hole plate. A total of 35 \u00b5l from each of these mixed samples were transferred into 1.7 mm outer diameter NMR tubes in a SampleJet rack used for the NMR experiments.","Nmr spec: All 1H NMR experiments were performed at 288.1 K, using a Bruker 600 MHz spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz for proton and equipped with an inverse detection cryogenic probe (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany).","Nmr assay: For all samples, the 1H NMR spectra were acquired using a CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) pulse sequence with an echo-time of 160 ms. The 90\u00b0 pulse length was approximately 10 \u03bcs as calculated automatically for each sample. A total of 256 scans were collected into 32 k data points with a spectral width of 12 ppm.","Data transformation: The free induction decays for one-dimensional data were zero-filled to 64 k data points and multiplied by an exponential function with a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. All one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra were manually corrected for phase and baseline distortions using TOPSPIN 2.1 (BrukerBiospin) and referenced to the TSP signal at \u03b4 0.0 ppm. 1H NMR spectral regions \u03b4 0.5\u20139.0 were binned with a width of 0.004 ppm (2 Hz) using the AMIX package (v3.9.3, BrukerBiospin). The 1H NMR spectra were normalized to the total sum of the spectral integrals to compensate for sample concentration differences. Subsequently, the multivariate data analyses were carried out using the SIMCA-P + software package (v12.0, Umetrics, Ume\u00e5, Sweden). Initially, the principal component analysis (PCA) of the 1H NMR spectral data was performed (on mean-centered data) to visualize the general structure of each data set and to identify any abnormalities (based on the principles of Hotelling T2) within the data set. Next, the supervised multivariate methods, projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal-projection to latent structure-discriminant analysis (O-PLS-DA) [1] was applied to the analysis of 1H NMR spectral data scaled to unit variance (UV) in order to uncover metabolic differences. O-PLS is an extension of the partial least square regression method featuring an integrated orthogonal signal correction filter [2]. The interpretation of the model is facilitated by a back-scaled transformation of the loadings, with incorporated color-coded correlation coefficients (MATLAB v7.1, The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, USA) of the metabolites responsible for the differentiation as described by Cloarec et al [3]. In short, each back-scaled loading is plotted as a function of the respective chemical shift with a color code that indicates the weights of the discriminatory variables. A hot color (red) corresponds to the metabolite being markedly different between classes, while a cool color (blue) corresponds to no differences between classes. In order to validate and avoid the risk of over-fitting the PLS model, a sevenfold cross-validation was used, i.e. iterative construction of models by repeatedly leaving out one-seventh of the samples, and predicting them back into the model. This procedure results in a cross-validation parameter Q2, indicating the predictability of the model in relation to its statistical validity. An additional cross-validation tool, a permutation test, was performed for each model: 200 models were constructed with the use of randomized classification for the samples and Q2 generated from these models were compared to the Q2 of the real model. If the maximum value of Qmax2 from the permutation test was smaller than the Q2 of the real model, the model was regarded as a predictable model. Similarly, the R2 was used to evaluate possibly over-fitted models. A final significance test was performed with the use of a CV-ANOVA (analysis of variance of the cross-validated residuals) test to verify the models validity [4]. The models were only considered to be valid if the permutation test and the CV-ANOVA test were satisfied at the same time. In order to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the established models receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) of true positive rates were plotted as a function of false positive rates in SPSS using cross-validated Y prediction values. The subsequent areas of under the ROC curves were also calculated in SPSS. Ref: [1]. Bylesj\u00f6 M, Rantalainen M, Cloarec O, Nicholson JK, Holmes E, Trygg J.

For the comparisons between CD and controls, two samples contained 5-aminosalicylic acid and N-acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid and these samples were excluded from the analysis. The decision to exclude the two CD samples and thus keep the aromatic region in the remaining CD samples, as opposed to the UC samples, is based on the principle of keeping as many data as possible in order to generate valid results.

Typical metabolomics data show a few but significant correlations among metabolite levels when data sampling is repeated across individuals grown under strictly controlled conditions. Although several studies have assessed topologies in metabolomic correlation networks, it remains unclear whether highly connected metabolites in these networks have specific functions in known tissue- and\/or genotype-dependent biochemical pathways. In our study of metabolite profiles we subjected root tissues to gas chromatography-time-of-flight\/mass spectrometry (GC-TOF\/MS) and used published information on the aerial parts of 3 Arabidopsis genotypes, Col-0 wild-type, methionine over-accumulation 1 (mto1), and transparent testa4 (tt4) to compare systematically the metabolomic correlations in samples of roots and aerial parts. We then applied graph clustering to the constructed correlation networks to extract densely connected metabolites and evaluated the clusters by biochemical-pathway enrichment analysis. We found that the number of significant correlations varied by tissue and genotype and that the obtained clusters were significantly enriched for metabolites included in biochemical pathways. We demonstrate that the graph-clustering approach identifies tissue- and\/or genotype-dependent metabolomic clusters related to the biochemical pathway.

Alkane standard mixtures (C8\u2013C20 and C21\u2013C40) were purchased from Sigma\u2013Aldrich (Tokyo, Japan) and were used for calculating the retention index (RI). The normalized response for the calculation of the signal intensity of each metabolite from the mass-detector response was obtained by each selected ion current that was unique in each metabolite MS spectrum to normalize the peak response, using the method of Kopka et al [2]. The normalized responses are peak areas corrected using the sample weight and a constant amount of the representative internal standard compound ([\u00b9\u00b3C\u2084]-hexadecanoic acid).

Peaks were identified or annotated based on retention indices (RIs) and the reference mass spectra comparison to the Golm Metabolome Database (GMD) and our in-house spectral library.The amount of S-adenosyl-methionine was calculated by the sum of the mass numbers at m\/z 188 and 236 using Leco ChromaTOF software version 2.32 (LECO, St. Joseph, MI, USA) since this compound was not adequately detected by H-MCR. Statistical analysis: Metabolomic data were log2 transformed and then statistically analyzed using the rank product method to identify differentially changed metabolites with the Bioconductor 'RankProd' package. Significantly changed metabolites showed a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05. The FDR value in the rank product was obtained with 1,000 random permutations. PCA was performed with the Bioconductor 'pcaMethods' package. To reduce outlier-related artifacts, the Spearman rank correlation (r), which is relatively robust to outliers and is based only on monotonicity, was used for comparative metabolomic correlations. To identify differences between correlations, we tested whether two correlations manifested different strengths using Fisher Z-transformation. The local false-discovery rate (fdr) was determined with the 'fdrtool' package. The significance level was set at fdr < 0.05. All statistical tests were performed with the R program http:\/\/www.r-project.org\/. To identify co-accumulated metabolite groups we used DPClus, a graph clustering algorithm that can extract densely connected nodes as a cluster. It is based on density- and periphery tracking of clusters. DPClus is freely available from http:\/\/kanaya.naist.jp\/DPClus\/. In this study, we used the overlapping-mode with the DPClus settings because we are confident that extracting clusters with the overlapping-mode is consistent with the overlapping of many of the metabolic pathways and protein complexes. We set the parameter settings of cluster property cp; density values were set to 0.5. To assess the statistical significance of clusters obtained by graph clustering, we subjected datasets of the aerial parts and roots of the 3 Arabidopsis genotypes and 100 randomly-generated sets of clusters to KEGG enrichment."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS45","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS45","title":"Metabolomic correlation-network modules in Arabidopsis based on a graph-clustering approach","date":"2014-03-01","timestamp":1393632000,"submitter":["Atsushi Fukushima"],"publications":[{"title":"Metabolomic correlation-network modules in Arabidopsis based on a graph-clustering approach","doi":"10.1186\/1752-0509-5-1","pubmed":"PMID:21194489"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Leco Pegasus III","organism":["Arabidopsis thaliana","Alkane standard"],"organism_parts":["root","pure substance"],"metabolites":["PR-MST","DL-Lactic acid (2TMS)","Glycolic acid (2TMS)","L-Alanine (2TMS)","Glycine (2TMS)","Oxalic acid (2TMS)","Dihydrouracil (2TMS)","DL-Valine (2TMS)","Urea (2TMS)","Benzoic acid (1TMS)","Ethanolamine (3TMS)","Phosphoric acid (3TMS)","DL-Leucine (2TMS)","Isoleucine (2TMS)","DL-Proline (2TMS)","Nicotinic Acid (1TMS)","Glycine (3TMS)","Succinic acid-2,2,3,3-d4 (2TMS)","DL-Glyceric acid (3TMS)","MST","Fumaric acid (2TMS)","DL-Serine (3TMS)","Pipecolic acid (2TMS)","Threonic acid-1,4-lactone (2TMS)","DL-Threonine (3TMS)","O-Acetyl-L-Serine (2TMS)","Glutaric acid (2TMS)","beta-Alanine (3TMS)","DL-Malic acid (3TMS)","sumoC4","Erythritol (4TMS)","D-Threitol (4TMS)","Salicylic Acid-3,4,5,6-d4 (2TMS)","DL-Aspartic acid (3TMS)","DL-Methionine (2TMS)","DL-Pyroglutamic acid-13C5,15N (2TMS)","gamma-Amino-n-butyric acid (3TMS)","Threonic acid (4TMS)","2-Hydroxyglutaric acid (3TMS)","alpha-Ketoglutaric acid (1MEOX) (2TMS)","L-Glutamic acid (3TMS)","DL-Phenylalanine (2TMS)","sumoC5","D-Xylose (1MEOX) (4TMS)","D-Arabinose (1MEOX) (4TMS)","DL-Asparagine (3TMS)","1,6-Anhydro-beta-D-glucose (3TMS)","Glycerol-2-phosphate (4TMS)","DL-Rhamnose (1MEOX) (4TMS)|DL-Fucose (1MEOX) (4TMS)","Putrescine-2,2,3,3-d4 (4TMS)","DL-Glycerol-3-phosphate (4TMS)","L-Glutamine (3TMS)","Shikimic acid (4TMS)","Citric acid (4TMS)","Dehydroascorbic acid dimer (4TMS)","n-Tetradecanoic acid (1TMS)","D-(-)-Fructose (5TMS)","Allantoin (4TMS)","D-Mannose (1MEOX) (5TMS)","D-(+)-Glucose (5TMS)","Lysine (4TMS)","D-(+)-Galacturonic acid (5TMS)","DL-Tyrosine (3TMS)","1-O-Methyl-beta-D-glucopyranoside (4TMS)","D-Glucopyranose (5TMS)","sudiC6-C6","Galactonic acid (6TMS)","Gluconic acid (6TMS)","n-Hexadecanoic acid (1TMS)","myo-Inositol (6TMS)","Linoleic acid (1TMS)","Oleic acid (1TMS)","Stearic acid (1TMS)","Spermidine (5TMS)","D-Fructose 6-phosphate (6TMS)","D-Mannose-6-phosphate (6TMS)","D-Glucose-6-phosphate (6TMS)","myo-Inositol-1-phosphate (7TMS)","Nicotianamine (4TMS)","Sucrose (8TMS)","D-(+)-Trehalose (8TMS)","S-Adenosyl-L-methionine (3TMS)","n-Tetracosanoic acid (1TMS)","Galactinol (9TMS)","Cholesterol (1TMS)","Campesterol (1TMS)","Stigmasterol (1TMS)","Raffinose (11TMS)","beta-Sitosterol (1TMS)"]}},"MTBLS295":{"description":["Both marine phytoplankton and terrestrial plants have to deal with limited bioavailability of the key life nutrient, phosphate. In freshwater algae and plants, a phosphate starvation response gene (psr1) has been characterized, which encodes for a transcription factor that regulates the metabolic response to phosphate deficiency. This study describes a psr1-like gene present in Micromonas pusilla and other prasinophytes as well as the haptophyte, Emiliana huxleyi. The metabolic response of M. pusilla to P-deficiency, as described from targeted and untargeted metabolomics techniques, was characteristic of an algal response to nutrient limitation with an increase in polyunsaturated fatty acids. The levels of many central metabolites, such as amino acids, vitamins, nucleosides, decreased in response to P-deficiency, with a few notable exceptions including malate, aspartate, glutamate, guanine and xanthine. Additionally, genes involved in the metabolic pathways associated with the elevated metabolites share a significant motif in their intron regions, which may be the regulatory element where the psr1 gene product binds. Results form the present study taken together with data from the literature suggests that M. pusilla, other prasionophytes and E. huxleyi, may be physiologically well poised to take advantage of a future ocean with lower nutrient levels and increased levels of pCO2.","Sample collection: Micromonas pusilla CCMP 1545 was purchased from the National Center for Marine Algae and Microbiota (Boothbay, ME, USA) and grown in 300 ml of L1-Si media (https:\/\/ncma.bigelow.org\/algal-recipes) using 0.2 \u00b5m filtered (Omnipore filters; Millepore, MA, USA) sterilized seawater from Vineyard Sound (MA, USA) as a base. Cultures were grown for several generations in L1-Si media, following which cultures were grown separately and simultaneously in regular L1-Si media with a 36 \u00b5M phosphate (P-replete) and phosphate deficient (P-deficient) L1-Si media with 0.4 \u00b5M. A starter culture in exponential phase of each media type was used to inoculate 18 flasks of media with approximately 10% of the volume (33, 37 ml for P-replete and P-deficient cultures, respectively) totaling 320 ml volume and approximately 300,000 cells. Another six flasks, three for each media type, contained only the media as cell-free controls. The cultures were maintained at 22 \u00baC under a 12:12 light:dark regime (84 \u00b5mol\/m2\/s) and were sampled at approximately 1 hr into the light cycle, at each time point. Cultures were grown for two weeks and samples were taken on at the time of experimental setup (T0; day 0) and in log phase (T1; day 4 P-deficient; day 6 P-replete) and stationary phase (T2; day 5 P-deficient; day 13 P-replete).","Extraction: The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol described by [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 90:10 (v\/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g\/ml) as an internal standard. For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg\/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile. The filtrate for each sample, representing the extracellular metabolite fraction, was processed using SPE as described above (following [1]) but with 1 g\/6 cc cartridges. The extracellular metabolite extract was redissolved in 500 \u00b5l of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics analysis. Ref: [1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 min, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 min, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng\/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration. For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis.","Mass spec: For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite. For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS\/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every six samples in order to assess instrument variability.","Data transformation: Targeted metabolomics data were analyzed using XCalibur 2.0. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng\/ml. Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [2], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [3], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m\/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA [4] was used to extract the intensities and m\/z values for the associated MS\/MS spectra.

Omics techniques can be applied for the assessment of this perturbation. In this study, the overall effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation on cultured human hepatocyte lipidome and metabolome has been investigated using NMR in combination with traditional techniques. The effect of two additional bioactives sharing with DHA the lipid lowering effect - propionic acid (PRO) and protocatechuic acid (PCA) - has been also evaluated, also considering possible synergism. NMR analysis of the cell lipid extracts showed that DHA supplementation, alone or in combination with PCA or PRO, strongly altered the cell lipid profile. The perfect discrimination between cells receiving DHA (alone or in combination) and the other cells reinforced the idea of a global rearrangement of the lipid environment induced by DHA. Notably, GC and fluorimetric analyses totally confirmed the strong discrimination obtained by NMR. The DHA signature was evidenced not only in the cell lipidome, but also in the metabolome. Results herein reported indicate that NMR, combined with other techniques, represents a fundamental approach while studying the effect of the supplementation of bioactives, particularly in the case of molecules having a broad spectrum of mechanisms of action.","Sample collection: HepG2 human hepatoma cells were kept at 37 \u00b0C, 95% air, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v\/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U\/ml penicillin and 100 mg\/ml streptomycin.

DHA was dissolved in 100% ethanol, and complexed to bovine serum albumin (BSA); fatty acid\u2013BSA complexes were prepared fresh each time at a final BSA concentration of 0.5% in serum-free DMEM. PCA was dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) acidified with HCl (at pH 2), while PRO was dissolved in water. The final concentration of ethanol and DMSO was kept below 0.1% in serum-free DMEM.

Untargeted metabolomics based on 1H NMR showed that HBCD exposure disturbed mice metabolism in both dosed groups, especially in high dosed group. The low-dose HBCD led to a decrease in alanine, malonic acid, and trimethylamine (TMA). High-dose HBCD-treated mice developed high levels of citric acid and 2-ketoglutarate, together with decreased alanine, acetate, formate, TMA, 3-hydroxybutyrate, and malonic acid. Targeted metabolomics for metabolic profiling of 20 amino acids identified alanine, lysine, and phenylalanine as significantly disturbed metabolites.

Prior to experiments, lens settings and source parameters were optimized to the signal of PE 34:1 (using protonated\/deprotonated molecular ion in positive\/negative ion mode, respectively) infused into the column effluent of 80% mobile phase B with a mixing tee. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Source Voltage 4.5 kV; source temperature 375 \u00b0C; sheath gas 25 arbitrary units (AU); aux gas 9 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Full scan spectra from m\/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m\/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 60,000 (FWHM at m\/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation either in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) or in the C trap (higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) experiments) and detected in the ion trap or the Orbitrap analyzer, respectively. For CID experiments, the 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energies were 50 for positive ion mode. For HCD experiments, fragment spectra of the 4 most abundant ions were collected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a target resolution of 7,500 (FWHM at m\/z 400, isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation time 0.1 ms). Exclusion time (duration after fragmentation for excluding ions with similar m\/z) was set to 10 s. Normalized collision energy settings were 25 for positive ion mode.

Source parameters were as follows: Capillary temperature 100 \u00b0C; desolvation temperature 400 \u00b0C; nebulizer gas nitrogen. Capillary voltage was 2.6 kV in positive and 2.1 kV in negative ionization mode. Lock spray was achieved by an external pump (L 6200, Hitachi) at a flow rate of 200 \u00b5l\/min with a 1:13 split. Leucine-enkephaline ([M+H]+: m\/z 556.2771 and [M H] : m\/z 554.2615) was used as lock mass and measured every 20 s with a scan time of 0.7 s independent of the other scan modes, allowing for continuous mass correction. This error was always below 5 ppm. For MS experiments, the Survey Scan Mode was used with the following settings: MS mass range V mode; extended dynamic range 200 1,000 m\/z; scan time 0.5 s; MS\/MS mass range 50 to 1,000 m\/z; MS\/MS threshold 10 counts\/s, up to 3 ions selected for MS\/MS; MS\/MS scan time, 0.4 s. An inclusion list containing m\/z values of the ions of interest was used for MS\/MS experiments.

However, in the liver and kidney, ER stress also leads to lipid accumulation, accompanied at least in the liver by transcriptional suppression of metabolic genes. The mechanisms of this accumulation are unclear, including which pathways contribute to the phenotype in each organ. We combined gene expression profiling, biochemical assays, and untargeted lipidomics to understand the basis of stress-dependent lipid accumulation, taking advantage of enhanced hepatic and renal steatosis in mice lacking the ER stress sensor ATF6\u03b1. We found that impaired fatty acid oxidation contributed to the early development of steatosis in the liver, but not the kidney; while anorexia-induced lipolysis promoted late triglyceride and free fatty acid accumulation in both organs. These findings provide evidence for both direct and indirect regulation of peripheral metabolism by ER stress.","Sample collection: Animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility under climate controlled conditions with a 12-hr light\/dark cycle, and were maintained on standard rodent chow.

By comparing the metabolic responses in MCF-7 cells, we identified the activation of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) in methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced DNA damage. PARP activation led to a significant depletion of NAD+. PARP inhibition using veliparib (ABT-888) was able to successfully restore the NAD+ levels in MMS-treated cells. In addition, double strand break induction by MMS and veliparib exhibited similar metabolic responses as zeocin, suggesting an application of metabolomics to classify the types of DNA damage responses. This prediction was validated by studying the metabolic responses elicited by radiation. Our findings indicate that cancer cell metabolic responses depend on the type of DNA damage responses and can also be used to classify the type of DNA damage.","Sample collection: MCF-7 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, high glucose, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen) and 1% penicillin\/streptomycin (P\/S, Invitrogen) in T-75 flasks until they reached subconfluence (~90% or ~10 million cells). Cells were treated with DNA damaging agents: cisplatin (Biotang Inc.), methyl methane sulfonate (Acros Organics), zeocin (Invivogen) or a phosphate buffered saline (PBS, Invitrogen) control for 24 h (or 1 h in the case of MMS followed by 23 h of recovery due to rapid DNA damage induction in the case of MMS due to a higher rate of interaction with the DNA as compared to other drugs) before harvesting. Cells were treated with the PARP inhibitor veliparib (ABT-888) (Selleckchem) or PBS containing DMSO (1 lg\/ml) 24 h prior to other drug treatments. Stock solution for all drugs, except for veliparib which was in DMSO, were prepared in PBS. All experiments were performed in three independent, biological replicates. To identify appropriate dosage of radiation treatment, MCF-7 cells were seeded in 6 well plates and after reaching subconfluency, cells were irradiated with 137Cs source (J. L. Sheppard Mark I unit) at a dose rate of 221 rad\/min with a total dose of 4, 8 or 12 Gy and the cell growth over the next 2 days was calculated using hemocytometer. 8 Gy treatment for 48 h led to a ~80% survival and the samples were collected for NMR analysis.","Extraction: The cells were quenched using 3 ml methanol using the protocol described previously [1]. Briefly, the culture medium was aspirated and the cells were immediately rinsed twice with ice-cold PBS (pH 7.4). The residual PBS was removed using vacuum aspiration and the cells were quenched using 3 ml HPLC grade methanol (Sigma-Aldrich). The cells were then detached using a cell scraper and pipetted into 50 ml centrifuge tube. A dual phase extraction procedure detailed previously [2] was used to extract the intracellular metabolites. Briefly, the quenched cells suspended in a mixture of chloroform, methanol and water in the ratio of 6:6:5.4 to make the final volume of 17.4 ml. The aqueous layer (top) contains the water-soluble low-molecular weight metabolites while the organic layer (bottom) contains non-polar metabolites. Proteins and other macromolecules are precipitated by addition of methanol and chloroform and trapped between the aqueous and organic layer. After centrifugation for 15 min at 3600 rpm, only the upper aqueous layer was used for further analysis. The samples were dried at 30 \u00baC using a centrifugal vacuum concentrator and stored in -80 \u00baC until NMR analysis. Ref: [1] Teng et al.

Each spectrum consisted of 128 transients or free induction decays (FIDs) collected into 48 K complex data points with a spectral width of 12 ppm and an acquisition time of 4 s. Prior to Fourier transformation, the FIDs were zero-filled to 128k data points and multiplied by an exponential window function (LB=0.5Hz). The chemical shifts were referenced to the TMSP peak (d=0 ppm), using TopSpinTM software (version 3.1, Bruker).","Data transformation: Spectra were exported to ACD\/1D NMR Processor (Advanced Chemistry Development) for phasing, baseline correction and solvent region removal (water: 4.7-5.1 ppm and DMSO: 2.72-2.75 ppm).","Metabolite id: The peaks were annotated through the HMDB [1] and Metabohunter [2] and the targeted profiling [3] was accomplished using ChenomX NMR Suite Profiler (version 7.7, ChenomX Inc.) and the concentrations were referenced to a TMSP concentration of 0.5 mM.

However, the medicinal value of P. ginseng fruits remain poorly characterized. Using gas chromatography-time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF MS), 66 metabolites including amino acids, sugars, organic acids, phenolic acids, phytosterols, tocopherols, and policosanols were identified and quantified. Some of these are well known medicinal compounds and were not previously identified in ginseng. Interestingly, the concentration of almost all metabolites was higher in the Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Parallel comparison of the four cultivars also revealed higher amounts of the medicinal metabolites in Chunpoong and Gumpoong cultivars. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ginseng fruits are a rich source of medicinal compounds with potential beneficial health effects.","Sample collection: In this study, four P. ginseng cultivars were used. These are: (i) Yunpoong with violet stem and red fruits, (ii) Gumpoong with green stem and yellow fruits, (iii) Chunpoong with majorly green stem and orange fruits, and (iv) Cheongsun with green stem and red fruits.

After saponification, samples were immediately placed on ice, and deionized water (1.5 ml) was added. Hexane (1.5 ml) was then added to each sample and vortexed for 20 s, followed by centrifugation (1200 x g, 5 min). The upper layer was pipetted into a separate tube, and the pellet was re-extracted using hexane. The hexane fraction was dried in a centrifugal concentrator (CVE-2000; Eyela, Tokyo, Japan).

The modes of regulation at the metabolome level can be revealed by metabolic networks. We investigated the metabolic network between wild-type and 2 mutant (methionine-over accumulation 1 [mto1] and transparent testa4 [tt4]) plants regarding the alteration of metabolite accumulation in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the GC-TOF\/MS analysis, we acquired quantitative information regarding over 170 metabolites, which has been analyzed by a novel score (ZMC, z-score of metabolite correlation) describing a characteristic metabolite in terms of correlation. Although the 2 mutants revealed no apparent morphological abnormalities, the overall correlation values in mto1 were much lower than those of the wild-type and tt4 plants, indicating the loss of overall network stability due to the uncontrolled accumulation of methionine. In the tt4 mutant, a new correlation between malate and sinapate was observed although the levels of malate, sinapate, and sinapoylmalate remain unchanged, suggesting an adaptive reconfiguration of the network. Gene-expression correlations presumably responsible for these metabolic networks were determined using the metabolite correlations as clues. Two Arabidopsis mutants, mto1 and tt4, exhibited the following changes in entire metabolome networks: the overall loss of metabolic stability (mto1) or the generation of a metabolic network of a backup pathway for the lost physiological functions (tt4). The expansion of metabolite correlation to gene-expression correlation provides detailed insights into the systemic understanding of the plant cellular process regarding metabolome and transcriptome.","Sample collection: Wild-type A.thaliana plants accession Columbia (Col-0) and the mutants mto1 and tt4 of Col-0 background were obtained from Dr. Naito, Hokkaido University, and Dr. Kitamura, Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute, respectively. The sterilized seeds were stratified at 5 \u00b0C for 2 d, and were successively sown on Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium containing 1% sucrose. Plants were cultivated in controlled growth chambers at 22 \u00b0C in 16-h light and 8-h dark conditions for 18 d. The aerial regions were harvested with 20 different biological replicates, 6 h after the onset of the bright phase. Among these harvested plants, the plants that had fresh weight over 13 mg were used for GC-TOF\/MS analysis (WT, n = 17; mto1, n = 13; and tt4, n = 20). All the plant materials were frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen to quench the enzymatic activity.","Extraction: Each sample was extracted with a concentration of 25 mg fresh weight of tissues per \u00b5l extraction medium (methanol\/chloroform\/water [3:1:1 v\/v\/v]) containing 10 stable isotope reference compounds using a Retsch mixer mill MM310 at a frequency of 30 Hz for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C. Each isotope was adjusted to a final concentration of 22.5 ng per \u00b5l injection. After centrifugation for 5 min at 15,100 x g, 400 \u00b5l of the supernatant was used for further analysis.

Here we have undertaken a detailed metabolomic analysis of two species, Mycoplasma bovis and Mycoplasma gallisepticum, which cause economically important diseases in cattle and poultry, respectively. Untargeted GC\/MS and LC\/MS analyses of mycoplasma metabolite extracts revealed significant differences in the steady state levels of many metabolites in central carbon metabolism, while 13C stable isotope labelling studies revealed marked differences in carbon source utilization. These data were mapped onto in silico metabolic networks predicted from genome wide annotations. The analyses elucidated distinct differences, including a clear difference in glucose utilisation, with a marked decrease in glucose uptake and glycolysis in M. bovis compared to M. gallisepticum, which may reflect differing host nutrient availabilities. The 13C-labeling patterns also revealed several functional metabolic pathways that were previously unannotated in these species, allowing us to assign putative enzyme functions to the products of a number of genes of unknown function, especially in M. bovis. This study demonstrates the considerable potential of metabolomic analyses to assist in characterising significant differences in the metabolism of different bacterial species, and in improving genome annotation.","Sample collection: M. bovis PG45 and M. gallisepticum Ap3AS were grown aerobically at 37 \u00b0C in modified Frey\u2019s broth (mycoplasma broth, MB) containing 10% swine serum for 18 hr.

Differential chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (CIL LC-MS) can overcome the matrix effect on MS detection based on measuring the intensity ratios of metabolite peak pairs detected in a mixture of a light-isotope labeled sample and a heavy-isotope labeled reference sample. However, the chemical labeling process itself may encounter matrix effect which can influence the overall quantitative results. In this work, we report the effects of salts and buffers commonly present in metabolomic samples on dansylation labeling. It is shown that high concentrations of NaCl and phosphate buffer (>50 mM) or PBS can reduce or enhance the labeling efficiencies of metabolites. By maintaining similar matrix contents in an individual sample vs. a reference sample, relative quantification of metabolites can be performed without compromising the metabolomic profiling results. For samples containing varying amounts of high salts such as urine, we demonstrate that the matrix effect can be largely overcome by diluting the original sample before dansylation labeling (e.g., 4-fold dilution for urine).","Sample collection: Urine samples were collected from five age-matched healthy mice. Equal volumes of the five individual samples were mixed together to make a pooled sample. After sample collection, the urine samples were immediatelystored in -80 \u00b0C freezer for further use.","Extraction: The frozen urine samples were thawed in an ice-bath and then centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 15 min. 12.5 \u00b5l supernatant was taken into an Eppendorf tube and totally dried using a Speed Vac.

After 45 min incubation at 40 \u00b0C, 10 \u00b5l of 250 mM NaOH was added to the reaction mixture to quench the excess dansyl chloride. The solution was then incubated at 40 \u00b0C for another 10 min. Finally, formic acid in 50\/50 ACN\/H2O was added to consume excess NaOH and to make the solution acidic.

Although causality cannot be inferred from association studies, patients in whom the primary cause of insulin resistance can be genetically defined, offer unique opportunities to address this challenge. Therefore, we compared metabolite profiles in patients with congenital lipodystrophy or loss-of-function insulin resistance (INSR) mutations with healthy controls. The absence of significant differences in TAG species in the INSR group suggest that changes previously observed in epidemiological studies are not purely a consequence of insulin resistance. The presence of TAGs with lower carbon numbers and high saturation in patients with lipodystrophy suggests that these metabolite changes may be associated with primary adipose tissue dysfunction. The observed pattern of TAG species is indicative of increased de novo lipogenesis (DNL). To test this we investigated the distribution of these TAGs in lipoprotein fractions using size exclusion chromatography prior to mass spectrometry. This associated these TAGs with VLDL particles, and hence release of TAGs into the blood from the liver. To test further the hepatic origin of these TAGs we induced DNL in the mouse, comparing ob\/ob and wild type mice on a chow or high fat diet, confirming that DNL induced an increase in relatively shorter, more saturated fatty acids. Overall, these studies highlight DNL in the pathogenesis of metabolic dyslipidaemia in states where energy intake exceeds the capacity of adipose tissue.<\/p> The protocols and data for human samples are reported in the current study MTBLS162.<\/br> The protocols and data for mice samples are reported in the study MTBSL327.","Sample collection: Fasting blood samples were obtained from patients with severe insulin resistance caused by either loss-of-function mutations in the insulin receptor gene (INSR) or congenital generalised or partial lipodystrophy.","Extraction: Human plasma samples (15 \u00b5l) were extracted using an automated Flexus sample preparation unit to minimize experimental variation.

In particular, there was a pronounced elevation of dihydrobiopterin (BH2), a compound produced in the synthesis of dopa, dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, in the second trimester, whereas it was markedly decreased in the third trimester. The turnover of BH2 and tryptophan catabolites indicated that the fluctuations of neurotransmitters throughout pregnancy might reveal the metabolic adaption in the maternal body for the growth of the fetus. Furthermore, 11 lipid classes and 41 carnitine species were also determined and this showed variations in the presence of long-chain acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids in later pregnancy, suggesting changes of acylcarnitines and lysophospholipids to meet the energy demands in pregnant women.","Sample collection: Venous blood was collected using Vacuette EDTA blood collection tubes in the morning before breakfast from all the participants, and then plasma samples were separated at 2200 x g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C from vein blood and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Independent samples were collected for each subject in independent class instead of multiple collection for each subject, which more closely reflected pregnancy-related variability larger than intersubject changes in the general population.","Extraction: Non-targeted metabolic profiling,: 50 \u03bcl of thawed plasma samples were collected and then precipitated by 200 \u03bcl of methanol. After centrifugation at 14000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant was transferred to a 1.5 ml polypropylene tube and 10 \u03bcl of the supernatant was injected into the HPLC\u2013MS. A \"quality control\" (QC) sample was also prepared by mixing equal volumes (10 \u03bcl) from each plasma sample before sample preparation as they were aliquoted for analysis. This \"pooled\" sample was used to estimate a \"mean\" profile representing all the analytes encountered during the analysis. Shotgun lipidomics and carnitine profiling: 10 \u03bcl of plasma was placed in a 1 ml glass vial. Then 8 \u03bcl of the internal standards mixture consisting of ceramide (Cer, d18:1\/17:0), phosphatidylserine (PS, 17:0), phosphatidylcholine (PC, 18:3), l-\u03b1-phosphatidylinositol (Soy PI), phosphoethanolamine (PE, 17:0), and phosphoglycerol (PG, 17:0) with a concentration of 10 \u03bcM for each lipid was added. Afterwards, 800 \u03bcl of chloroform\/methanol\/water (20:10:1, V\/V\/V) containing 300 mM ammonium acetate was added again and the mixture was vortexed. After centrifuging for 10 min at 14000 x g, 10 \u00b0C on a centrifuge (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany), 100 \u03bcl of the lower organic layer was diluted with 100 \u03bcl of methanol\/chloroform (2:1, V\/V) containing 10 mM ammonium acetate. The final mixture were transferred into a new vial and stored at -20 \u00b0C until analysis.","Chromatography: Non-targeted Metabolic Profiling: LC\u2013MS system was run in binary gradient mode. Solvent A was 0.1% (v\/v) formic acid\/water, and solvent B was 0.1% (v\/v) formic acid\/methanol. The flow rate was 0.2 ml\/min. A C-18 column (150 mm \u00d7 2.1 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent, USA) was used for all analysis. The gradient was as follows: 5% B at 0 min, 5% B at 5 min, 100% B at 8 min, 100% B at 9 min, 5% B at 18 min, and 5% B at 20 min. The pooled \"QC\" sample was injected five times at the beginning of the run to ensure system equilibrium and then every 10 samples to further monitor the stability of the analysis.","Mass spec: LC\u2013MS data was acquired using Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu) coupled online to a LTQ Orbitrap Velos instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific, MA, USA) set at 30000 resolution (at m\/z 400). Sample analysis was carried out in both positive and negative ion modes. The mass scanning range was 50\u20131500 m\/z, and the capillary temperature was 350 \u00b0C. Nitrogen sheath gas was set at a flow rate of 30 l\/min. Nitrogen auxiliary gas was set at a flow rate of 10 l\/min. Spray voltage was set to 4.5 kV for positive ion mode and 3 kV for negative ion mode. Lipidome and carnitine profiling were detected by multiplexed precursor ion scanning (MPIS) analysis. First, 100 \u03bcl of final extract was loaded in a well of a 96-well plate (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) and then sealed with aluminum foil. The final extracts were then analyzed using a QTRAP 5500 System equipped with a Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system (Shimadzu). Liquid chromatography and flow injection analysis\u2013mass spectrometry were employed to acquire the data. The electrospray source was operated in the positive ion mode. Optimized source parameters were: ionspray voltage 5.5 kV, source temperature 300 \u00b0C, curtain gas 30. Collision energies ranged from 25 to 30 V for various lipid species in precursor ion or neutral loss scan modes. Flow injections analysis was performed with a mixture of chloroform\u2013methanol\u201310 mM ammonium acetate in water (300\/665\/35, V\/V\/V) at a flow rate of 200 \u03bcl\/min.

Cell lines derived from neuroblastoma brain tumors provide a good model to study the consequences of NPY activation of Y2R in tumor metabolism. In this study, the metabolic response to activation and inhibition of Y2R was examined in the human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE2 using high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Three treatments were evaluated: (1) activation of Y2R with NPY, (2) blocking Y2R with BIIE0246, and (3) treatment of cells with both NPY and BIIE. The largest metabolic changes were observed for NPY activation of Y2R. The principal response to NPY activation of Y2R was increased glycolysis (Warburg effect). Our results also showed depleted intracellular nutrients in NPY activated cells, which may have been due to the high rate of conversion of glucose to lactate, glycine and alanine. All amino acids except glutamine were increased in response to Y2R activation, implying increased autophagic degradation of proteins. TCA cycle intermediates were not detected, possibly due to low steady-state concentrations, but the increase of glutamate and its high correlation with glucose provided evidence of increased TCA activity. The changes of most metabolites observed upon NPY treatment were reversed with BIIE treatment. In summary, our study indicates that NPY activation of Y2R in human neuroblastoma cells stimulates glycolysis, glutaminolysis and possibly TCA activity.","Sample collection: The human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE2 was used in this study. The neuroblastoma cells were grown in Eagle's essential medium (EMEM), supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FBS), penicillin (100 IU\/ml) and streptomycin (100 \u00b5g\/ml) in a 95% air\/5% CO2 humidified atmosphere at 37 \u00b0C as reported previously [1]. When the cells became 90% confluent (4\u20135 days), medium was replaced with the EMEM containing 0.25% FBS, and was used in the treatment experiments described below. Three treatments were studied. Group 1 compared NPY-treated cells to a control (water) to monitor the cellular response to activation of Y2R by NPY. In Group 2, the Y2R receptor was blocked by BIIE (dissolved in ethanol) in treated cells and compared to cells treated with neat ethanol as a control. In Group 3, cells were treated with BIIE plus NPY versus NPY treatment alone to study the effect of selective blocking of Y2R in this Y2R-rich cell line. The dose concentration of NPY 100 nM and BIIE0246 was 1 \u00b5M. The dose values were chosen basedon published values shown to activate and inhibit NPY Y2R, respectively, in different tissue\/cell systems [1][2]. The SK-N-BE2 cellswere treated with 1 \u00b5M Y2R antagonist, BIIE0246 in 0.25% FBS containing DMEM media. Fifteen minutes later 100 nM NPY was added to the cells and the incubation continued for additional 24 h and the media and the cells were extracted for the analysis. The order of treatment was antagonist first, 15 min later the agonist was added. NPY treatment for 48 h has been shown to increase cell growth by 40% and this increase was blocked by BIIE0246 [2]. The relative affinity of NPY (agonist) for Y2R is 0.2 nM and BIIE0246 (antagonist) is 15 nM [1]. When cells were grown to 75\u201385% confluence in 10 cm culture dishes, the media was aspirated and cells were trypsinized using trypsin\u2013EDTA solution (Invitrogen). Fresh growth media containing 10% FBS was added to the trypsinized cells (10:1 ratio) and centrifuged for 5 min at 1,500 rpm at 4 \u00b0C. The spent media was aspirated and stored for analysis and the cell pellet was washed with 10 ml of cold phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, and centrifuged again as above. This step was repeated two more times and the cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until removal for cell extraction.

Data were recorded at 298 K using 3 mm NMR tubes (Norell) with a spectral width of 17 ppm.","Nmr assay: Two 1H NMR experiments optimized were run on all samples: a standard 1D pulse and acquire pulse sequence employing water-suppression using pre-saturation (zgpr) and the one-dimensional first increment of a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) experiment with pre-saturation (noesygppr1d). FIDs were apodized using exponential multiplication (EM) with line broadening equal to 0.3 Hz prior to Fourier transformation. All experiments included on-resonance water pre-saturation achieved by irradiation during a 4.0 s relaxation delay. The 90\u00b0 pulse width was determined for every sample using the automatic pulse calculation feature in TopSpin 3.1. All pulse widths were 8.5\u00b10.5 \u00b5s. The zgpr experiment was used to screen samples and ensure that pre-saturation and shimming were sufficient to collect reliable data. Shimming quality was determined by measuring the full width at half height (FWHH) of the Trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) peak, which was deemed acceptable when the FWHH<1.0 Hz. One-dimensional zgpr 1H spectra were acquired using 8 scans and 2 dummy scans, with 45 K points per spectrum. This resulted in an acquisition time of 1.92 s. Once the spectrum was determined to be of acceptable quality the 1D NOESY experiment was collected. The one-dimensional first increment of the NOESY experiment was collected using 128 scans with 4 dummy scans. 65 K points per spectrum were collected which resulted in an acquisition time of 3.21 s. All NMR spectra were processed using the AU program apk0.noe. This AU program automatically corrects phase, baseline, and chemical shift registration relative to TSP in TopSpin 3.1.","Data transformation: NMR spectra bucketing and PCA were conducted using Amix (Bruker Biospin, Billerica, MA, USA). Dynamic manual bucketing enabled use of unequal bucket widths, which allowed for optimization of the bucket widths and the center frequency of the buckets to ensure that a single peak was included in one bucket. Consequently, the manual bucketing guaranteed that the bucket intensity accurately preserve metabolite concentration information [1]. Prior to manual bucketing, spectral were aligned relative to the added TSP. After alignment, buckets belonging to the same metabolite and the same peak feature were determined manually as well. Any spectral features that were obviously overlapped based on visual inspection were excluded from the analysis. All spectra were subjected to total intensity normalization [2] and Pareto scaling [3] was applied before PCA. Residual water and internal standard peaks were excluded from analysis. Statistical significance analysis of the loadings data was performed using Amix based on the procedure we have previously published [4] except that a Kruskal\u2013Wallis test [5] was used instead of the Mann\u2013Whitney U test for non-parametric analysis of datasets that were not normally distributed.

Previous investigations have explored the effects of carbohydrate prefeed in murine models but few in clinically relevant large animal models. We performed carbohydrate prefeed in pigs undergoing simulated polytrauma and hemorrhagic shock with resuscitation to determine if carbohydrate prefeeding if the metabolic response to shock is dependent on fed state. Sixty-four Yorkshire pigs were divided into two experimental groups: fasted and prefed in additon to two Control groups. Experimental animals were subjected to a standardized hemorrhagic shock protocol, including pulmonary contusion and liver crush injury. To determine molecular alterations in response to trauma as a result of prefeeding, liver and muscle biopsies in addition to serum and urine samples were obtained at set timepoints throughout the procedure. The samples were prepared and analyzed by NMR spectroscopy.","Sample collection: Liver and skeletal muscle: Sixty four (64) juvenile, male Yorkshire pigs were used in this study. Other results from this group of animals have been previously published [1][2][3]. Two experimental groups were utilized: Carbohydrate Prefed (CPF, n = 32) and Fasted (FS, n = 32). CPF animals were given 7 cc\/kg bolus of Karo Syrup\u00ae (mixture of sugars including ~15% glucose, maltose, fructose and sucrose) diluted with water 1 hr prior to induction of anesthesia. The full experimental polytrauma and shock protocols have been described in detail previously [2][4]. Briefly, animals were instrumented and splenectomized. Polytrauma was induced by a captive bolt device to create a blunt percussive injury to the chest and a liver crush injury using a Holcomb clamp technique [5]. Hemorrhagic shock was then induced by withdrawal of blood from the inferior vena cava until a systolic pressure of 45\u201355 mmHg was reached for 45 min (S45) to simulate delay prior to medical attention. Typically, this resulted in withdrawal of ~40% of the pig\u2019s blood volume. Blood was placed in an acid-citrate-dextrose bag for later use. Following the shock period, animals received lactated Ringer\u2019s fluid given as 20 cc\/kg intravenous(IV) boluses to maintain a systolic blood pressure greater than 80 mmHg for 1 h of limited resuscitation to simulate transportation to a medical center; then underwent full resuscitation protocol for the following 24 h. This resuscitation included fluid, shed blood, and ventilator support in a protocolized fashion. After the resuscitation period, animals were extubated and sent to recovery and subsequently euthanized. At several time points throughout the experiment, peripheral liver and skeletal muscle biopsies were taken ranging in weight from 0.2 to 0.6 g. Biopsies were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until preparation for NMR analysis. Biopsies were taken at the following timepoints: baseline after the animal stabilized from instrumentation (B), 45 min after hemorrhage (S45), 2, 8, and 20 h after full resuscitation (FR2, FR8, FR20). Changes induced by hemorrhagic shock polytrauma and 'early' resuscitation were denoted as the difference between S45 and B (S45-B) and between FR2 and S45 (FR2-S45) respectively. Serum: Twenty-three (23) juvenile male Yorkshire-crossbred pigs were used in this study. Upon stabilization, and after the measurement of baseline variables,the animals underwent a simulated pulmonary contusion by using a captive bolt device (Ramset, Glendale Heights, IL) to create a blunt percussive injury with a 0.22 caliber load by placing the device under the front, right limb on the sixth or seventh rib from the bottom. Hemorrhagic shock was induced by the removal of blood via inferior vena cava catheter into acid-citrate-dextrose blood bags to obtain a systolic blood pressure of less than 50 mm Hg (typically 35-50% of total blood volume). A liver crush injury was induced using a modified Holcomb clamp technique with two crush injuries made in the liver parenchyma that result in a grade 2 liver injury[5]. The abdomen was closed after shock and hypotensive resuscitation. After 45 minutes of shock, animals received 1 hour of limited resuscitation (to simulate transport to definitive care), followed by 20 hours of a standard resuscitation protocol. Throughout the shock and resuscitation periods, animals were maintained on the ventilator and received an adjusted dose of propofol and nitrous oxide to maintain an appropriate level of sedation and comfort as evaluated by a clinical examination and a bispectral index monitor. At 20 hours following the initiation of full resuscitation, surviving animals had all lines removed, venous lines were tunneled for access, and the animals were closed in three layers. The animals were then awakened, extubated and sent to recovery and subsequently euthanized. Blood samples were collected from the animals at baseline (before hemorrhage), at shock (after 45 minutes of shock), and at 8 hours of full resuscitation. After clotting, blood was immediately centrifuged for 15 min at 3000 g to extract serum, transferred to a clean tube, and stored at 4 \u00b0C overnight. All samples were then stored at -80 \u00b0C until prepared for NMR analysis. Urine: Forty male Yorkshire pigs (Manthei Hog Farm, LLC, Elk River, MN) weighing between 15 and 20 kg were randomized to experimental group, Negative control, (Positive) control, Fasted, and Pre-fed. One control group underwent surgical preparation without shock or trauma (non-hemorrhaged). A second control group underwent all experimental interventions but did not receive resuscitation (non-resuscitated). Animals in the two experimental groups underwent all experimental manipulations as described below and differed in that one group received a bolus of 140 ml of Karo\u00ae Syrup with 140 ml water 30 min prior to experimental manipulation (pre-fed) while the other group received only water for 12 h prior to intervention (fasted).

However, surveillance of chemical exposure and disease-related changes in large cohorts requires an analytical platform that offers rapid measurement, high sensitivity, efficient separation, broad dynamic range, and application to an expansive chemical space. Here, we present a novel platform for small molecule analyses that addresses these requirements by combining solidphase extraction with ion mobility spectrometry and mass spectrometry (SPE-IMS-MS). This platform is capable of performing both targeted and global measurements of endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics in human biofluids with high reproducibility (CV <= 3%), sensitivity (LODs in the pM range in biofluids) and throughput (10-s sample-to-sample duty cycle). We report application of this platform to the analysis of human urine from patients with and without type 1 diabetes, where we observed statistically significant variations in the concentration of disaccharides and previously unreported chemical isomers. This SPE-IMS-MS platform overcomes many of the current challenges of large-scale metabolomic and exposomic analyses and offers a viable option for population and patient cohort screening in an effort to gain insights into disease processes and human environmental chemical exposure.","Sample collection: Urine was collected from type 1 diabetes (T1D) patients and healthy siblings associated with Children\u2019s National Medical Center (CNMC). The Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes program at the CNMC is the largest center in the mid-Atlantic region of the United States, caring for approximately 1600 juvenile patients with T1D. A comprehensive human subject protocol was developed to ensure patient confidentiality, including all clinical and molecular meta-data collected during recruitment, and that the procedures for specimen collection were not associated with direct health risks. A human subject consent form was designed with sufficient information for the to-be-enrolled sibling pairs and their parents\/guardians (for subjects less than 18 yrs of age) to allow them an assessment of the public benefits of the research and the confidentiality loss or health risks. The consent form and protocol were approved by the Internal Review Boards at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) and CNMC. PNNL staff had access to patient identifier codes but not the names or addresses of the study participants. The urine specimens were stored up to 4 weeks at -20 \u00baC at the CNMC clinical site and transferred to the PNNL for storage at -80 \u00baC until further use.","Extraction: A urease pretreatment procedure was performed before methanol extraction on the urine samples. 50 \u00b5l of urease solution was added to 50 \u00b5l of urine samples, vortexed briefly and spun down. The mixture was incubated at 37 \u00baC with mild shaking (500 rpm) for 30 min and then cooled on ice for 1 min. Methanol extraction was performed by adding 1 ml of ice-cold methanol to the urine solution after urease pre-treatment. The mixture was then vortexed for 30 s and centrifuged at 15,000 x g at 4 \u00baC for 10 min. The supernatants were collected and dried under speed vacuum for 4 h. 500 \u00b5l HPLC grade water was added for SPE-IMS-MS analyses. An aliquot of the human urine was run at least once every 20 samples and used as quality control for all urine measurements. Twenty xenobiotic standards (see Table S1 in the paper assocaited with this study) were analyzed individually at concentration levels of 10 pM, 100 pM, 1 nM, 10 nM, 100 nM and 1 \u00b5M to determine their limits of detection (LODs) prior to biofluid addition. A mixed stock solution was then prepared using a 99.9\/0.1 acetonitrile\/formic acid buffer solution and 10 \u00b5M of each chemical for SPE-IMS-MS method optimization. The mix was added into the human urine extract to achieve final concentration levels of 500 pM, 1 nM, 5 nM, 10 nM, 50 nM and 100 nM for each chemical and the LOD was determined (see Table S1).","Chromatography: A RapidFire 365 Solid Phase Extraction (SPE) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was interfaced to an Agilent 6560 Ion Mobility QTOF MS system[1][2] (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). The RapidFire 365 uses high-speed robotics and fast-switching valves to facilitate ultra-fast online SPE. A 10 \u00b5l sample loop was used for all experiments. A C18 SPE cartridge (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) was selected for the initial experiments. The system was optimized to maximize the binding efficiency, while minimizing carry-over, using the xenobiotic standard mixture. To overload the sample loop, 30 \u00b5l of each urine sample was loaded onto the SPE cartridge using a combination of 0.1% formic acid and 99.9% water (v\/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at1.5 ml\/min), and eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 49.95% isopropanol (IPA) and 49.95% methanol (v\/v\/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 ml\/min). Based on C18 SPE cartridge optimization of the small molecule polar extracts from urine, mixed mode, graphitic carbon, and HILIC cartridges were used to maximize detection coverage of small molecules with differing affinities. The same mobile phase A and B were applied to the mixed mode cartridge as described for the C18 cartridge. For the graphitic carbon cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using the same mobile phase A as used for C18 cartridge, but the small molecules were eluted using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 25% acetonitrile, 25% acetone and 49.9% water (v\/v\/v\/v) (mobile phase B, flow rate at 0.6 ml\/min). For the HILIC cartridge, the polar urine extracts were loaded using a combination of 0.1% formic acid, 10% IPA, 89.9% hexane (v\/v\/v) (mobile phase A, flow rate at 1.5 ml\/min), and small molecules were eluted using the same mobile phase B as used for the C18 cartridge. Aspiration time, load time, elution time and re-equilibration time were 0.6 s, 3 s, 6 s, and 1 ms, respectively, for a total cycle time of ~10 s. The sample injection sipper and valve loops were washed with water followed by acetonitrile between each sample injection.

Rather small changes in mass spectrometric spectrum acquisition parameters may have a significant influence on the detectabilities of metabolites in untargeted global-scale studies by means of high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). Employing whole cell lysates of human renal proximal tubule cells, we present a systematic global-scale study of the influence of mass spectrometric scan parameters on the number and intensity of metabolites detectable in whole cell lysates. Ion transmission and ion collection efficiencies in an Orbitrap-based mass spectrometer generally depend on the m\/z range scanned, which, ideally, requires different instrument settings for the respective mass ranges investigated. Therefore, we split a full scan range of m\/z 50-1000 relevant for metabolites into two separate segments (m\/z 50-200 and m\/z 200-1000), allowing an independent tuning of the ion transmission parameters for both mass ranges. Three different implementations, involving either scanning from m\/z 50-1000 in a single scan, or scanning from m\/z 50-200 and from m\/z 200-1000 in two alternating scans, or performing two separate HPLC-MS runs with m\/z 50-200 and m\/z 200-1000 scan ranges were critically assessed. The most efficient approach in terms of feature number, which forms the basis for statistical analysis, identification, and for generating biological hypotheses, was the separate analysis of two different mass ranges. This lead to an increase in the number of detectable metabolite features, especially in the higher mass range (m\/z greater than 400), by 2.5 (negative mode) to 6-fold (positive mode) as compared to analysis involving a single scan range. Application of the method to metabolite extracts prepared from whole cell lysates of human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells initially yielded up to 13,000 \u2013 69,000 detectable features, which were subjected to rigorous background filtering and quality control in order to obtain reliable metabolite features for subsequent differential quantification.","Sample collection: The human renal proximal tubule cell line RPTEC\/TERT1 was obtained from Evercyte GmbH (Vienna, Austria). The RPTEC\/TERT1 cells [1] were cultured on 1 \u00b5m PET 24 mm tissue culture inserts for MTX and PTX, and on 0.2 \u00b5m aluminium oxide 25 mm inserts for TCX, and differentiated as previously described [2]. Briefly, cells were grown in a serum-free hormonally-defined medium for epithelial monolayer maturation and CAA exposure. After reaching a stable average trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) of ~ 150 Ohm.cm^2, mature monolayers were exposed to either a high (35 \u00b5M) or low (10 \u00b5M) concentration of CAA or control medium, on both the apical and the basolateral sides [3].

To preserve metabolites, 750 \u00b5l ice cold methanol containing deutero-alanine (50 \u00b5M) as internal standard were added. Two wells were pooled in an Eppendorf tube, vortexed and sonicated with an in-probe-sonicator from Branson Ultrasonics Corporation (Danbury, CT, USA) for 20 s to fully homogenize the sample. Finally, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 \u00b0C at 14000 rpm for 10 min.

The flow rate was 0.30 ml\/min, and gradient elution was carried out as follows: 100% A for 1.5 min followed by a linear gradient to 100% B in 6.5 min and holding for 2 min. In the end a re-equilibration step was performed for 3.0 min at 100% A. The total run time was 13 min.

An ESI heater temperature of 350 \u00b0C was chosen and sheath gas and aux gas flow rates were set to 20 and 5.0 arbitrary units in positive mode and to 35 and 10 in the negative mode, respectively. A sprayer voltage of 3.0 kV was applied and the resolution was set to 50,000. The mass range was split into a low mass range m\/z 50-200 and a high mass range m\/z 200-1000 and measured in two separate runs. The MS parameters were tuned for each method and polarity separately with selected metabolites. For the low mass range the best intensities were achieved with a capillary voltage of 25 V, tube lens voltage of 70 V, skimmer voltage of 14 V for positive and negative mode with changed polarity. The high mass range measurements were conducted with a capillary voltage of 55 V and -45 V, tube lens voltage of 115 V and -105 V, skimmer voltage of 22 V and -24 V for positive and negative mode respectively.","Data transformation: The raw data was converted to mzML using msconvert. Centroiding, metabolic feature detection and linking were performed using OpenMS. A feature consists of all peaks that belong to the same metabolite with a certain charge state and adduct. Features were identified separately for each sample; matching features are then linked across all samples. Feature intensities were normalized by a pairwise comparison between each sample and the sample with the most features. For each pairwise comparison we computed the average intensity ratio and multiplied all feature intensities in the respective map by the inverse. Strict feature filtering was carried out using KNIME. The employed filtering removed chemical background (= signals also observed in blank runs), as well as features showing unstable intensity in the quality control samples, which indicated that the corresponding metabolites could not be reliably used for differential quantification.","Metabolite id: No metabolites were identified in this study."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS233","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS233","title":"Improving global feature detectabilities through scan range splitting for untargeted metabolomics by high-performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry","date":"2016-06-09","timestamp":1465426800,"submitter":["Christina Ranninger","Lukas Schmidt","Marc Rurik","Alice Limonciel","Paul Jennings","Oliver Kohlbacher","Christian Huber"],"publications":[{"title":"Improving global feature detectabilities through scan range splitting for untargeted metabolomics by high-performance liquid chromatography-Orbitrap mass spectrometry","doi":"10.1016\/j.aca.2016.05.017","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Exactive (Thermo Scientific)","organism":["blank","Homo sapiens"],"organism_parts":["blank","renal tubule"]}},"MTBLS437":{"description":["Rice (Oryza sativa L.) is a candidate crop for production of plant-based vaccines by genetic engineering technologies.

Here, we performed non-targeted metabolomic profiling of MucoRice-CTB to understand the overall effects of the genetic engineering on rice seed metabolism using gas chromatography\/time-of-flight mass spectrometry.","Sample collection: In this study, we used two transgenic rice lines (abbreviated as MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi) and their parental non-transgenic rice cultivar (O. sativa L. cv. Nipponbare; abbreviated as NPB). MR-CTB51A is a transgenic rice line expressing modified CTB and RNA interference (RNAi)-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-CTB transgenic rice line 51A [1]). MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line expressing RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes (MucoRice-RNAi [2]). In both MR-CTB51A and MR-RNAi, the RNAi-triggers for endogenous seed storage protein genes were designed to suppress both prolamin and glutelin gene expression [1,2]. However, the RNAi-trigger sequences and its promoter differed between the two transgenic rice lines [1,2]. In MR-CTB51A, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) coding sequence (CDS) positions 1\u201345 and GluB1 (Os02g0249800) CDS positions 139\u2013366 (controlled by 10 kDa prolamin promoter) [1]. In MR-RNAi, the trigger sequences were 13 kDa prolamin clone RM1 (Os07g0206500) CDS positions 1\u201345 and GluA2 (Os10g0400200) CDS positions 142\u2013270 (controlled by ubiquitin promoter) [2].MR-CTB51A is a selection marker-free transgenic rice line generated by an agrobacterium-mediated co-transformation method [1]. In contrast, MR-RNAi is a transgenic rice line harbouring a selection marker gene, hygromycin phosphotransferase (HPT), under the control of cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter [2]. MR-CTB51A and NPB plants were hydroponically grown in a growth chamber (for details see Kashima et al. [3]). Brown rice samples from NPB plants grown hydroponically were named NPB-HP. NPB plants were also grown in an open-air paddy field (Niigata, Japan) using a conventional method. A brown rice sample from the NPB plants grown in the paddy field was named NPB-PF. MR-RNAi plants were grown in a soil pot in a growth chamber (for details see Kurokawa et al. [2]). Rice ears were harvested from MR-CTB51A, MR-RNAi, and NPB plants at least 40 days after heading. After harvesting, the ears were dried in a ventilated incubator for several days until the water content dropped to approximately 10%. From the dried rice ears, rice grains were collected. The husks of the grains were removed to obtain brown rice. Brown rice samples from MR-CTB51A, NPB-HP, and NPB-PF were stored at 4 \u00b0C for up to 1\u20132 weeks. MR-RNAi was stored at room temperature for 4 years. Brown rice samples were powdered and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until use.

There are no cures or disease-modifying therapies, and this may be due to our inability to detect the disease before it has progressed to produce evident memory loss and functional decline. Biomarkers of preclinical disease will be critical to the development of disease-modifying or even preventative therapies. Unfortunately, current biomarkers for early disease, including cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta levels, structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging and the recent use of brain amyloid imaging or inflammaging, are limited because they are either invasive, time-consuming or expensive. Blood-based biomarkers may be a more attractive option, but none can currently detect preclinical Alzheimer's disease with the required sensitivity and specificity. <\/p> Herein, we describe our lipidomic approach to detecting preclinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease in a group of cognitively normal older adults. We discovered and validated a set of ten lipids from peripheral blood that predicted phenoconversion to either amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer\u2019s disease within a 2\u20133 year timeframe with over 90% accuracy. This biomarker panel, reflecting cell membrane integrity, may be sensitive to early neurodegeneration of preclinical Alzheimer's disease. <\/p> In this study, a combination of targeted and untargeted metabolomics\/lipidomics approach was used in conjunction with statistical analysis for identification of a bio-signature of pre-clinical Alzheimer\u2019s disease.","Sample collection: A detailed protocol for sample collection is mentioned in the published paper associated with this study. Briefly blood was collected in EDTA collection tubes, centrifuged and frozen at -80 \u00b0C within 4 hrs of collection.","Extraction: Briefly, the plasma samples were thawed on ice and vortexed. For metabolite extraction, 25 \u00b5l of plasma sample was mixed with 175 \u00b5l of extraction buffer (25% acetonitrile in 40% methanol and 35% water) containing internal standards (10 \u00b5l of debrisoquine (1 mg\/ml), 50 \u00b5l of 4-nitrobenzoic acid (1 mg\/ml), 27.3 \u00b5l of ceramide (1 mg\/ml) and 2.5 \u00b5l of LPA (lysophosphatidic acid) (4 mg\/ml) in 10 ml). The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged at 14,000 r.p.m. at 4 \u00b0C for 20 min. The supernatant was transferred to a fresh tube and dried under vacuum. The dried samples were reconstituted in 200 \u00b5l of buffer containing 5% methanol, 1% acetonitrile and 94% water. The samples were centrifuged at 13,000 r.p.m. for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove fine particulates. The supernatant was transferred to a glass vial for Ultraperformance liquid chromatography\u2013electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) analysis.","Chromatography: Each sample (2 \u00b5l) was injected onto a reverse-phase CSH C18 1.7 \u00b5M, 2.1 mm x 100 mm column using an Acquity H-class UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA). The gradient mobile phase comprised of water containing 0.1% formic acid solution (Solvent A), 100% acetonitrile (Solvent B) and 10% acetonitrile in isopropanol containing 0.1% formic acid and 10 mM ammonium formate (Solvent C). Each sample was resolved for 13 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml\/min for 8 min and then 0.4 ml\/min from 8 to 13 min. The UPLC gradient consisted of 98% A and 2% B for 0.5 min and then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B and 40% A from 0.5 min to 4.0 min, followed by a ramp of curve 6 to 98% B and 2% A from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a ramp to 5% B and 95% C from 9.0 min to 10.0 min at a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min and finally a ramp to 98% A and 2% B from 11.0 min to 13 min. The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray ionization.","Mass spec: UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS for untargeted lipidomic profiling: Mass spectrometry was performed on a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) instrument (Xevo G2 QTOF, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in either negative (ESI-) or positive (ESI+) electrospray ionization mode with a capillary voltage of 3,200 V in positive mode and 2,800 V in negative mode and a sampling cone voltage of 30 V in both modes. The desolvation gas flow was set to 750 l\/h, and the temperature was set to 350 \u00b0C. The source temperature was set at 120 \u00b0C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of a lock-spray interface of leucine-enkephalin (556.2771 [M+H]+ or 554.2615 [M-H]-) at a concentration of 2 pg\/\u00b5l in 50% aqueous acetonitrile and a rate of 2 \u00b5l\/min. Data were acquired in centroid MS mode from 50 to 1,200 m\/z mass range for TOF-MS scanning as single injection per sample, and the batch acquisition was repeated to check experimental reproducibility. For the metabolomics profiling experiments, pooled quality control (QC) samples (generated by taking an equal aliquot of all the samples included in the experiment) were run at the beginning of the sample queue for column conditioning and every 10 injections thereafter to assess inconsistencies that are particularly evident in large batch acquisitions in terms of retention time drifts and variation in ion intensity over time. This approach has been recommended and used as a standard practice by leading metabolomics researchers. A test mix of standard metabolites was run at the beginning and at the end of the run to evaluate instrument performance with respect to sensitivity and mass accuracy. The overlay of the total ion chromatograms of the quality control samples depicted excellent retention time reproducibility. The sample queue was randomized to remove bias. Stable isotope dilution\u2013multiple reaction monitoring: LC-MSmass spectrometry (LC-MS\/MS) is increasingly used in clinical settings for quantitative assay of small molecules and peptides such as vitamin D, serum bile acid and parathyroid hormone under Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments environments with high sensitivities and specificities. In this study, targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma samples was performed using the Biocrates Absolute-IDQ P180 (BIOCRATES, Life Science AG, Innsbruck, Austria). This validated targeted assay allows for simultaneous detection and quantification of metabolites in plasma samples (10 \u00b5l) in a high-throughput manner. The methods have been described in detail [1][2]. The plasma samples were processed as per the instructions by the manufacturer and analyzed on a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer (Xevo TQ-S, Waters Corporation, USA) operating in the MRM mode. The measurements were made in a 96-well format for a total of 148 samples, and 7 calibration standards and 3 quality control samples were integrated in the kit. Briefly, the flow injection analysis tandem mass spectrometry (MS\/MS) method was used to quantify a panel of 144 lipids simultaneously by multiple reaction monitoring. The other metabolites are resolved on the UPLC and quantified using scheduled MRMs. The kit facilitates absolute quantitation of 21 amino acids, hexose, carnitine, 39 acylcarnitines, 15 sphingomyelins, 90 phosphatidylcholines and 19 biogenic amines.

The m\/z features of metabolites were normalized with log transformation that stabilized the variance, followed by a quantile normalization to make the empirical distribution of intensities the same across samples.","Metabolite id: Metabolite identification and annotation was done using metabosearch tool which integrates several databases and was developed by Habtom Ressom's group at GU. Untargeted lipidomic profiling: The metabolites were selected among all those known to be identifiable using a ROC regularized learning technique based on the LASSO penalty as implemented with the R package 'glmnet'[1], which uses cyclical coordinate descent in a path-wise fashion. We first obtained the regularization path over a grid of values for the tuning parameter, lambda, through tenfold cross-validation. The optimal value of the tuning parameter lambda, which was obtained by the cross-validation procedure, was then used to fit the model. All the features with nonzero coefficients were retained for subsequent analysis. This technique is known to reduce overfitting and achieve similar prediction accuracy as the sparse supporting vector machine. The classification performance of the selected metabolites was assessed using area under the ROC curve (AUC). The ROC can be understood as a plot of the probability of classifying correctly the positive samples against the rate of incorrectly classifying true negative samples. So the AUC measure of an ROC plot is a measure of predictive accuracy. To maintain rigor of independent validation, the simple logistic model with the ten-metabolite panel was used, although a more refined model can yield greater AUC. The validation phase was performed in a blinded fashion such that the sample group was not known by the statistical team. Stable isotope dilution\u2013multiple reaction monitoring: Data analysis was performed using the MetIQ software (Biocrates), and the statistical analyses included the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis test with follow-up Mann-Whitney U-tests for pairwise comparisons using the STAT pack module v3 (Biocrates). Significance was adjusted for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni's method (P < 0.025). The abundance is calculated from area under the curve by normalizing to the respective isotope labeled internal standard. The concentration is expressed as nmol\/L. Human EDTA plasma samples spiked with standard metabolites were used as quality control samples to assess reproducibility of the assay. The mean of the coefficient of variation (CV) for the 180 metabolites was 0.08, and 95% of the metabolites had a CV of <0.15. Ref: [1] Friedman, J., Hastie, T. & Tibshirani, R.

Metabolomic technologies currently facilitate acquisition of multivariate metabolic data using diverse, mostly hyphenated, chromatographic detection systems, such as GC-MS or liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy or NMR-based methods. Analysis of the resulting data can be performed through a combination of non-supervised and supervised statistical methods, such as independent component analysis and analysis of variance, respectively. These methods reduce the complex data sets to information, which is relevant for the discovery of metabolic markers or for hypothesis-driven, pathway-based analysis. Plant responses to salinity involve changes in the activity of genes and proteins, which invariably lead to changes in plant metabolism. Here, we highlight a selection of recent publications in the salt stress field, and use gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry profiles of polar fractions from the plant models, Arabidopsis thaliana, Lotus japonicus and Oryza sativa to demonstrate the power of metabolite profiling. We present evidence for conserved and divergent metabolic responses among these three species and conclude that a change in the balance between amino acids and organic acids may be a conserved metabolic response of plants to salt stress.","Sample collection: The metabolic profiling of A. thaliana was obtained from experiments carried out in soil under greenhouse conditions, following a gradual step-wise salt acclimation approach [1].

Salt treatment was for 20 days and started four days post-imbibition. Four days after imbibition, germinated plants were transplanted to soil and irrigated with the above nutrient solution. Salt treatment started eight days post-imbibition and samples were taken after 24 days. The salt content of the nutrient solution was increased in steps, 10, 25, 50 and 75 NaCl mM.

The administration of nandrolone starting at the time of tendon release prevents the increase in fat content, but does not revert established fatty infiltration. We hypothesised that tendon release and myotendinous retraction cause alterations in lipid related gene expression leading to fatty muscle infiltration, which can be suppressed by nandrolone through its genomic actions if applied immediately after tendon release. The effects of infraspinatus tendon release and subsequent tendon repair at 16 weeks were studied in six Swiss Alpine sheep. In the interventional groups, 150mg nandrolone was administered weekly after tendon release until sacrifice (N22W, n=6) or starting at the time of repair (N6W, n=6). Infraspinatus volume, composition, expressed transcripts, lipids, and selected proteins were analyzed at baseline, 16 and 22 weeks. Tendon release reduced infraspinatus volume by 22% and increased fat content from 11% to 38%. These changes were not affected by repair. Fatty infiltration was associated with up-regulation of 227 lipid species, and increased levels of the adipocyte differentiation marker PPARG2 (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2). Nandrolone abrogated lipid accumulation, halved the loss in fiber area percentage, and up-regulated androgen receptor levels and transcript expression in the N22W but not the N6W group. The results document that nandrolone mitigates muscle-to-fat transformation after tendon release via a general down-regulation of lipid accumulation concomitantly with up-regulated expression of its nuclear receptor and downstream transcripts in skeletal muscle. Reduced responsiveness of retracted muscle to nandrolone as observed in the N6W group is reflected by a down-regulated transcript response.","Sample collection: Biopsy samples were collected from infraspinatus muscle of sheep before (PRE) and after 16 weeks of tendon release (TR) and 6 weeks of subsequent repair (END) in the operated and contralateral (END-CC) muscle. A group of animals received intramuscular injections of nandrolone starting with the surgery (N22W). In another group injection of nandrolone was started at the time of tendon repair (N6W).

We investigated by lipidomic analysis whether such metabolic states are reflected in the lipidome of hepatocyte lipid droplets (LDs) from mice fed normal chow diet (FED), fasted (FAS), or fed a high-fat diet (HFD). LC-MS\/MS at levels of lipid species profiles and of lipid molecular species uncovered a FAS phenotype of LD enriched in triacylglycerol (TG) molecular species with very long-chain (VLC)-PUFA residues and an HFD phenotype with less unsaturated TG species in addition to characteristic lipid marker species. Nutritional stress did not result in dramatic structural alterations in diacylglycerol (DG) and phospholipid (PL) classes. Moreover, molecular species of bulk TG and of DG indicated concomitant de novo TG synthesis and lipase-catalyzed degradation to be active in LDs. DG species with VLC-PUFA residues would be preferred precursors for phosphatidylcholine (PC) species, the others for TG molecular species. In addition, molecular species of PL classes fitted the hepatocyte Kennedy and phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase pathways. We demonstrate that lipidomic analysis of LDs enables phenotyping of nutritional stress. TG species are best suited for such phenotyping, whereas structural analysis of TG, DG, and PL molecular species provides metabolic insights.","Sample collection: Wild-type male C57BL\/6 mice (Jackson Laboratory; Bar Harbor, ME) aged 12 weeks were used in this study. Mice were maintained on a regular light (14 h)\/dark(10 h) cycle and fed a standard laboratory chow diet (FED group) or high-fat diet (HFD group) containing 4.5 or 34 wt% fat in the diet, respectively. The third group of mice was fed a chow diet, but were fasted 14 h prior to euthanasia (FAS group). Starting with 6-week-old animals, the intervention trial was carried out two times under identical conditions. In each of the three groups, three animals were kept for 6 weeks in one cage per group with ad libitum access to food and water. During the intervention period, mice weights were monitored regularly. At the end of the 6 weeks feeding period, animals were euthanized at 8 AM under anesthesia with Narkodorm (60 \u00b5l\/100 g weight) and the abdomen was surgically opened. Primary hepatocytes from livers were isolated as described previouly [1] with modifications. Prior to liver perfusion, buffers and collagenase type II solution (20 mg collagenase type II in 100 ml Krebs-Henseleit buffer without SO4(2-) but containing 0.1 mM CaCl2, 2% BSA) were brought to 37 \u00b0C. Each liver was perfused via the hepatic portal vein with Krebs-Henseleit buffer without Ca2+ and SO4(2-) (115 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO3, 5.9 mM KCl, 1.18 mM MgCl2, 1.23 mM NaH2PO4, 6 mM glucose) for 10 min, followed by perfusion with collagenase type II solution. Thereafter, liver was carefully removed and transferred into a Petri dish filled with 5 ml collagenase type II solution, cut into small pieces, and pressed through a household sieve that was finally flushed with ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2. The cell suspension obtained was filtrated through a cell strainer (70 \u00b5m nylon filter) into a 50 ml Greiner tube. Approximately 20 ml ice-cold DMEM was added to the filtrated cell suspension, which was subsequently centrifuged at 50 x g in a Beckman CS-6R rotor for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant containing nonparenchymal cells was aspirated, and the remaining hepatocyte pellet was washed by resuspension of the cell pellet in 20 ml ice-cold Krebs-Henseleit buffer containing 1.2 mM Na2SO4 and 1.25 mM CaCl2 and centrifuged again under the same conditions as were applied before. Hepatocytes obtained in this manner were stored at 80 \u00b0C until isolation of LDs. Ref: [1] Riccalton-Banks L, Bhandari R, Fry J, Shakesheff KM.

PMID: 12870660 ","Extraction: Samples of hepatocytes isolated from individual mice were resuspended in disruption buffer (20 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 250 mM sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM PMSF) and kept for 15 min on ice. The cells were lysed by nitrogen cavitation at 800 psi for 10 min using nitrogen bomb, and the resulting homogenate was transferred to a 50 ml Greiner tube and centrifuged at 1,000 x g (Beckman CS-6R rotor) for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C to remove cell debris. The supernatant obtained was transferred to a SW41 ultracentrifuge tube and overlaid with buffer containing 50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1 mM PMSF. The centrifugation was carried out at 100,000 x g in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor, Beckman Coulter; Brea, CA) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C; LDs were floated in a white band at the top of the tube. Floating LDs were collected into another SW41 tube, overlaid with the same buffer, and centrifuged at the same speed in the Beckman ultracentrifuge (SW41 rotor) for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C to avoid cytosol contamination. Refloating LDs were collected and used in all further experiments. LDs isolated from hepatocytes were measured individually (6 each for FED, FAS, and HFD group) according to the hyphenated approach described previously [1]. In brief, samples were spiked with 40 nmol TG 17:0\/17:0\/17:0 and 400 pmol PC 12:0\/12:0 as internal standards, and lipids were extracted with methyl tert-butyl ether as described previously [2]. Lipid extracts were resuspended in 200 \u00b5l CHCl3\/MeOH 1:1, and a mix of 45 LIPID MAPS internal standards was added.

Solvent A was water with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid, solvent B was acetonitrile\/2-propanol 5:2 (v\/v) with 1% ammonium acetate and 0.1% formic acid. The gradient ran from 35% to 70% B in 4 min, then to 100% B in another 16 min, and was held there for further 10 min.

Spray voltage was set to 5,000 V in positive mode and to -4,500 V in negative mode, capillary voltage to 35 V, and the tube lens was at 120 V. Capillary temperature was set to 250 \u00b0C. From the FT-ICR-MS preview scan, the four most-abundant m\/z values were picked in data-dependent acquisition mode, fragmented in the linear ion trap, and ejected at nominal mass resolution. Normalized collision energy was set to 35%, repeat count was two, and exclusion duration was 60 s.","Data transformation: Quantitative analysis of data acquired by the platform described above was carried out by the software package Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA) [1]. Lipid species are presented in \u2030 of total amount of respective lipid class where appropriate for better comparisons. The total amount (1,000\u2030) was calculated by summing up the quantitative amounts of each lipid species belonging to this lipid class as determined by LS-MS\/MS.

Bioinformatics. 2011 Feb 15;27(4):572-7. PMID: 21169379 ","Metabolite id: Constituent FA of phosphatidylserine (PS), PE, PC, DG, and TG species were analyzed in positive MS\/MS spectra by respective FA neutral losses. FA composition of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) and sphingomyelins (SMs) was obvious by elemental composition derived from high-resolution MS data and by lipid class-specific fragments (m\/z 184). FA composition for phosphatidylinositol (PI) molecular species was elucidated by their carboxylate anions in negative MS\/MS spectra. The most abundant FA fragment or neutral loss in an MS\/MS spectrum was normalized to 100% (base peak). Fragments indicative for FA with less than 25% intensity of the base peak were termed minor FA fragments and all others were termed major FA fragments. For better manageability, particularly of isobaric species, possible combinations predominantly composed of major fragments were considered major molecular species, and possible combinations predominantly composed of minor fragments were considered minor molecular species. On the one hand quantitative mass spectrometric data for each lipid species are given in \u2030 (or %) relative to total amount of a lipid class and pertain to 1st and 2nd intervention trials, consequently they are means \u00b1 SD of 6 animals. Total lipid class amounts were calculated as sum from individual lipid species; the standard deviation of the lipid class is a result of the individual standard deviations of each species determined by the law of error propagation.","Data analysis: Independent two-sample t-test for equal sample sizes and equal variance was used to assess statistical significance of the observed changes at a level of P < 0.05. This type of calculation was chosen, because it illustrates relative changes in the lipid profile between different statistical groups very well. On the other hand mass spectrometric data for each lipid species in nmol (or \u00b5mol) per LD sample are presented as means \u00b1 SD (n = 3). These additional values pertain to the second intervention trial and were calculated by LDA based on sets of internal standards for each lipid class as described previously [1][2]. For better comparability, data were normalized to the amount of acylglycerols measured by the TG Kit referred to previously in this section. Principal component analysis (PCA) based on \u2030 data (n = 6) was performed in R using the function prcomp with default parameters.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

Compounds were identified using the TargetFinder plug-in of TagFinder-Software and a reference library of mass spectra and retention indices from the collection of the Golm Metabolome Database (http:\/\/csbdb.mpimp-golm.mpg.de\/csbdb\/gmd\/home\/gmd_sm.html; [1]). Thresholds for automated mass spectral prematching were match factor >650 and retention indices deviation <1.0%. Identifications were confirmed manually by co-chromatography of defined reference mixtures [2]. Data management, data transformation, and basic calculations were performed using Microsoft Office Excel 2003 options. The TM4 multi-experiment viewer [3] and the MetaGeneAlyse Web service [4] were employed for visual and statistical data assessment, e.g. ICA, one- and two-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, or Mack-Skillings tests.Ref: [1] Kopka J, Schauer N, Krueger S, Birkemeyer C, Usadel B, Bergmueller E, Doermann P, Weckwerth W, Gibon Y, Stitt M, et al (2005) GMD@CSB.DB: the Golm Metabolome Database.

We here report non-targeted metabolome of human blood that is made up of plasma and red blood cells (RBCs), using liquid-chromatography and mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Previously, metabolome of a microbe, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe, was reported. Two sets of metabolome results are highly similar in their compositions: among 133 compounds identified in human blood, 101 (75%) are also present in S. pombe, and among 57 compounds enriched in RBC, 45 (78%) are also present in S. pombe. Most abundant metabolites are ATP, glutathione and glutamine. Many of other relatively abundant metabolites identified are also implicated in energy, anti-oxidant and amino acid metabolism. We show fourteen newly-identified blood compounds; citramalate, GDP-glucose, trimethyl-histidine, trimethyl-phenylalanine, trimethyl-tryptophan, trimethyl-tyrosine, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, UDP-glucuronate, dimethyl-lysine, glutamate methyl ester, N-acetyl-(iso)leucine, N-acetyl-glutamate, N2-acetyl-lysine, and N6-acetyl-lysine (the first eight are enriched in RBC). Ten of them are also detected in S. pombe, and ten of them are methylated or acetylated, amino acids. Trimethylated or acetylated free amino acids are also abundant in white blood cell. Their physiologic role may be investigated in the future by yeast genetics. <\/p> Blood was separated by low speed (120 x g) centrifugation for 15 min.

However, the precise nature of these signals and whether their concentrations can be altered to affect the biological outcome of host-pathogen interactions remain speculative. Here we use a metabolomic comparison of resistant and susceptible genotypes to identify plant-derived metabolites that induce T3SS genes in Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato DC3000 and report that mapk phosphatase 1 (mkp1), an Arabidopsis mutant that is more resistant to bacterial infection, produces decreased levels of these bioactive compounds. Consistent with these observations, T3SS effector expression and delivery by DC3000 was impaired when infecting the mkp1 mutant. The addition of bioactive metabolites fully restored T3SS effector delivery and suppressed the enhanced resistance in the mkp1 mutant. Pretreatment of plants with pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) to induce PAMP triggered immunity (PTI) also restricts T3SS effector delivery and enhances resistance by unknown mechanisms, and the addition of the bioactive metabolites similarly suppressed both aspects of PTI. Together, these results demonstrate that DC3000 perceives multiple signals derived from plants to initiate its T3SS and that the level of these host-derived signals impacts bacterial pathogenesis.","Sample collection: Two-week-old Arabidopsis (ecotype Wassilewskija, Ws) plants grown on Murashige and Skoog agar medium, as well as the loss-of-function mutant mkp1(Ws) and mkp1 mpk6(Ws) plants described previously [1], were placed in water.

The metabolic activity was then studied by quantifying the proportion of key metabolites containing 13C in both perfusate and tissue samples. Results: There was significant enrichment of 13C in a number of central metabolites present in both the perfusate and tissue extracts and was most pronounced for lactate and alanine. The total amount of enriched lactate (per sample) in perfusion fluid increased during HMP (31.1 \u00b1 12.2 nmol at 6 hrs vs 93.4 \u00b1 25.6 nmol at 24 hrs p<0.01). The total amount of enriched alanine increased in a similar fashion (1.73 \u00b1 0.89 nmol at 6hrs vs 6.80 \u00b1 2.56 nmol at 24hrs (p<0.05). In addition, small amounts of enriched acetate and glutamic acid was evident in some samples. Conclusions: This study conclusively demonstrates that de novo metabolism occurs during HMP and highlights active metabolic pathways in this hypothermic, hypoxic environment. While the majority of the 13C-enriched glucose is metabolised into glycolytic endpoint metabolites such as lactate, the presence of non-glycolytic pathway derivatives suggests that metabolism during HMP is more complex than previously thought. Isotopic labelled ex vivo organ perfusion studies using 2D-NMR are feasible and informative.","Sample collection: Experiments were performed on 22\u201326-week-old \u2018bacon weight\u2019 pigs, weighing 80\u201385 kg (n = 6) as described elsewhere[1]. All experiments were performed following the principles of laboratory animal care according to NIH standards. To replicate human conditions, kidneys were initially cold flushed (4 \u00b0C) with 1 l Soltran solution under aseptic conditions at a pressure of 150 mmHg, followed by 2 h of cold storage. Organs were then perfused with 1 l of a modified version of KPS-1 solution containing 10 mM of [U-13C]-labelled glucose and 30 g of PEG 35 kDa as an impermeant in place of hydroxyethyl starch. The LifePort Kidney Transporter 1.0 (Organ Recovery Systems) was used for perfusion at a pressure of 30 mmHg (see Fig. 1 in the paper associated with this study). Kidneys were perfused for 24 h with perfusate sampled at times 6, 12, 18 and 24 hr from each kidney via the designated LifePort sampling port and stored at -20 \u00b0C. The samples were thawed at room temperature, prepared and processed as described below. Kidney cortex tissue samples were also taken at the study endpoint and flash frozen prior to homogenization.

PMID:25502759 ","Extraction: Perfusates: Perfusate samples were extracted using a chloroform\/methanol extraction. Briefly, 1.5 ml of perfusate was combined with 1.5 ml of chilled methanol (at -80 \u00b0C) and 1.5 ml chloroform (i.e. a 1:1:1 ratio). This was mixed vigorously for 10 min and then cooled on wet ice for 10 min. The polar and non-polar phases were separated by centrifugation (1300 x g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C) as described elsewhere[1][2]] and 2 ml of the polar fraction aspirated and dried at 30 \u00b0C overnight. Tissues: Immediately after storage, the kidneys were laterally bisected and sections of cortex were excised and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Sections of cortex were then pulverised to a fine powder using a manual cryogrinder. After this, 0.5 g of the powdered sample was added to a 7-ml Precellys homogenisation tube containing 5.1 ml of chilled methanol (-80 \u00b0C) to quench ongoing metabolism. The sample was homogenised using the Precellys 24 Dual homogeniser set at the lowest mode (5000 rpm for 15 s) until fully homogenised (this was standardised to 8 courses of the lowest setting with cooling in dry ice between runs to prevent overheating). Once homogenised, the samples were mixed with 4.65 ml ultrapure water accounting for the estimated 79% water (around 395 \u00b5l) present in the tissue already[3] and 5.1 ml chloroform (i.e. a 1:1:1 ratio as with the perfusate samples).

","Sample collection: Perfusates: The dried samples were resuspended in 480 \u00b5l NMR phosphate buffer containing 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 0.5 \u00b5M DSS (4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid), 2 mM imidazole, and 48 \u00b5l D20 (deuterium oxide), and vortexed until the dried pellet had completely dissolved. Following this, 35 \u00b5l of the sample was added to a 1.7-mm NMR tube, sonicated for 10 min to dissolve any remaining micro particles and then centrifuged to remove air bubbles. The sample was stored at 4 \u00b0C until processed. Tissues: Metabolite extraction and resuspension in NMR buffer was performed as in the perfusate sample preparation, with the exception that 4.5 ml of the top polar layer was aspirated and dried before resuspension in 60 \u00b5l of NMR phosphate buffer and 35 \u00b5l of this was added to a 1.7 mm NMR tube as before.","Nmr spec: Both 1D-1H NMR and 2D-1H,13C HSQC NMR spectra were acquired on a 600-MHz Bruker Avance III NMR spectrometer equipped with a TCI 1.7-mm z-PFG cryogenic probe at 300 K. NMR acquisition time was circa 5 hr per sample (see Fig. 4 in the paper associated with this study). The spectral widths for all spectra were set to either 7812.5 Hz (1H) or 24,155 Hz (13C).","Nmr assay: For the 1D-1H NMR spectra, 16,384 complex data points were acquired. For the 1H dimension of 2D-1H,13C HSQC NMR spectra, 512 complex data points were acquired. Out of 8192 complex data points (2458), 30% were sampled for the 13C dimension using an exponentially weighted non-uniform sampling scheme. Using a 4-s interscan relaxation delay, 128 transients were recorded for the 1D-1H NMR spectra. 2 transients per increment were recorded for the 2D-1H,13C HSQC NMR spectra. The interscan relaxation delay was set to 1.5 s. Each sample was automatically tuned, matched and then shimmed (1D TopShim) to a DSS line width of <1 Hz prior to acquisition of the first spectrum.","Data transformation: 1D-1H NMR spectra were processed using the MATLAB-based MetaboLab software[1]. All 1D data sets were zero-filled to 131,072 data points prior to Fourier transformation. The chemical shift was calibrated by referencing the DSS signal to 0 ppm. 1D spectra were manually phase corrected before correcting the spectral baseline using a spline function[1]. 2D 1H,13C HSQC NMR spectra were reconstructed with compressed sensing using the MDDNMR and NMRpipe software[2]-[4]. The spectra were zero-filled to 1024 (1H) times 16,384 (13C) real data points. HSQC spectra were then analysed using MetaboLab, which uses the pyGamma software for multiplet simulations[5]. The methyl group of lactate was used to calibrate the chemical shift based on its assignment in the human metabolome database [22]. Data were analysed using GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, USA). Data were reported as mean \u00b1 SD, unless stated otherwise. Statistical significance was tested using two-tailed Student\u2019s t test. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. Ref: [1] Ludwig C, G\u00fcnther UL.

After a resting period of two weeks, physiological data that include activity, temperature, ECG, and blood pressure were continuously collected.  Two weeks after activation of the telemetry implant, the macaques were inoculated intravenously with cryopreserved salivary gland sporozoites. The cryopreserved batch of <i>P. knowlesi<\/i> sporozoites were produced, isolated and cryopreserved at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from <i>Anopheles dirus<\/i>.  After experimental infection, the macaques were profiled for clinical, hematological, parasitological, immunological, functional genomic, lipidomic, proteomic, metabolomic, telemetric and histopathological measurements. The experiment was designed for terminal necropsies on days 11 (RKy15) or 19 (Red16).  The anti-malarial drug artemether was subcuratively administered selectively to one subject (REd16) during the primary parasitemia to suppress clinical complications. Capillary blood samples were collected daily for the measurement of CBCs, reticulocytes, and parasitemias. Capillary blood samples were collected every other day to obtain plasma for metabolomic analysis.

The first strategy is aimed at specifically analysing a limited number of known metabolites or compound classes. Alternatively, an unbiased approach can be used for profiling as many features as possible in a given metabolome without prior knowledge of the identity of these features. Using high-resolution mass spectrometry with instruments capable of measuring m\/z ratios with sufficiently low mass measurement uncertainties and simultaneous high scan speeds, it is possible to combine these two strategies, allowing unbiased profiling of biological samples and targeted analysis of specific compounds at the same time without compromises. Such high mass accuracy and mass resolving power reduces the number of candidate metabolites occupying the same retention time and m\/z ratio space to a minimum. In this study, we demonstrate how targeted analysis of phospholipids as well as unbiased profiling is achievable using a benchtop orbitrap instrument after high-speed reversed-phase chromatography. The ability to apply both strategies in one experiment is an important step forward in comprehensive analysis of the metabolome.","Sample collection: Plasma samples were collected from 10 healthy volunteers.

The most relevant toxin is deoxynivalenol (DON), which acts as a virulence factor of the pathogen. FHB is difficult to control and resistance to this disease is a polygenic trait, mainly mediated by the quantitative trait loci (QTL) Fhb1 and Qfhs.ifa-5A. In this study we established a targeted GC-MS based metabolomics workflow comprising a standardized experimental setup for growth, treatment and sampling of wheat ears and subsequent GC-MS analysis followed by data processing and evaluation of QC measures using tailored statistical and bioinformatics tools. This workflow was applied to wheat samples of six genotypes with varying levels of Fusarium resistance, treated with either DON or water, and harvested 0, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hours after treatment. The results suggest that the primary carbohydrate metabolism and transport, the citric acid cycle and the primary nitrogen metabolism of wheat are clearly affected by DON treatment. Most importantly significantly elevated levels of amino acids and derived amines were observed. In particular, the concentrations of the three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan increased. No clear QTL specific difference in the response could be observed except a generally faster increase in shikimate pathway intermediates in genotypes containing Fhb1. The overall workflow proved to be feasible and facilitated to obtain a more comprehensive picture on the effect of DON on the central metabolism of wheat.","Sample collection: Six different spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines were used in the experiments. Treated ears were sampled either directly after treatment (time point 0) or 12, 24, 48 and 96 hr after treatment. The ear was cut from the plant and the non-treated spikelets were removed by clipping the rachis with a surgical scissor below and above the treated spikelets. The treated ear part including the rachis and complete spikelets (chaff and florets) was put in a small vial. Harvested samples were immediately quenched in liquid nitrogen and subsequently stored at -80 \u00b0C until further processing. Each of the frozen wheat samples were milled to a fine powder for 2 min at 30 Hz using a ball mill (MM301 Retsch, Germany) with liquid nitrogen pre-cooled 10 ml stainless steel vessels and a 9-mm stainless steel ball.","Extraction: The homogenized wheat ears (100\u00b12 mg fresh weight) were weighed into Eppendorf tubes and extracted with 1 ml of pre-cooled methanol\/water 3+1 (v\/v) including 0.1% formic acid, by vortexing for 10 s and further treatment in an ultrasonic bath at room temperature for 15 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 8,500 x g at 4 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b5l of the supernatant were combined with 140 \u00b5l water, 75 \u00b5l chloroform and 10 \u00b5l of internal standard mixture. After shaking, the tubes were again centrifuged for 4 min at 8,500 x g at 4 \u00b0C and 200 \u00b5l of the methanol\/water phase were transferred into micro-inserts in GC\/HPLC vials. The samples were evaporated overnight using a centrifugal evaporator (Labconco, Kansas City, MO) at 15 \u00b0C and subsequently put on the GC autosampler (PAL LHX-xt, CTC Analytics, Carrboro, NC) for an optimized online two step derivatization procedure. The sample was re-suspended in 40 \u00b5l MOX (20 mg\/mL pyridine) and agitated for 90 min at 60 \u00b0C. Thereafter, 50 \u00b5l MSTFA and 10 \u00b5l internal standard (NONA, 370 mg\/l) were added before the vial was again agitated at 60 \u00b0C for 60 min. Prior to analysis, the samples were kept in the drawer for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C to allow equilibration and sedimentation of particles.","Chromatography: For separation and detection of analytes an Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph coupled to a 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany) was used. The instruments were controlled by ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, version E.02.01.1177). A volume of 1 \u00b5l of the liquid sample was injected into the split\/splitless injector at 250 \u00b0C in split mode and using a split of 25:1. An HP5-ms column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) was operated at a constant flow of 1 ml\/min helium. After keeping the oven at 50 \u00b0C for 2 min, it was heated to 310 \u00b0C (10 \u00b0C\/min) and subsequently kept at this temperature for 15 min.","Mass spec: Compounds were detected from m\/z 50-800 utilizing the 5975C inert XL MSD detector (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The MSD interface was kept at 290 \u00b0C throughout the run. After 7 min of solvent delay, the detector was used in scan mode m\/z 50\u2013800. The EI source was kept at 230 \u00b0C and the MSD quadrupole at 150 \u00b0C. Autotuning of the MSD was performed at least once a week or after exchange of spare parts, such as the liner which was exchanged after a maximum of 70 injections. All samples were measured in a randomized manner.","Data transformation: Raw GC-MS data files were acquired by ChemStation and exported in the net.cdf format. The converted files were subsequently imported by the MetaboliteDetector software (version 2.5.20130104-Linux) and further processed. Besides mass spectral deconvolution (settings: peak threshold 5; minimum peak height 5; deconvolution width 7; required number of peaks 20) and computation of feature areas for relative quantification, the retention index for compound recognition was calculated and the corresponding spectra were compared to an in-house library.","Metabolite id: Retention indices and GC-MS spectra were compared to an in-house library. This library was established by measuring 132 authentic reference standards using the same derivatization protocol, analytical parameters and instrument as the wheat samples analysed in this study. Metabolites were identified by comparison of mass spectra and retention indices to the spectra library using a cut-off value of 70%.

Previous studies have demonstrated that the aqueous extract of yerba mate (Ilex paraguariensis) provides effective therapy, in vitro, for the drug-resistant S. Typhimurium DT104. Unfortunately, while some of the chemical constituents that contribute to the extract\u2019s antibacterial activity have been identified, the mechanism of action of the extract is still unknown and of crucial importance to its future potential in combating antibiotic resistant bacteria.<\/br> Results: Yerba mate extract altered central carbon metabolism in S. Typhimurium, reduced catalase activity by means other than direct inhibition, and did not change membrane integrity (except at the initial 0 time point, where differences were not resolved) despite a significant increase in the production of a cell wall precursor. Additional significant differences were observed in the global metabolic regulators alpha-ketoglutarate and acetylphosphate, the energy-related molecule NAD+, and in an unexpected match to the antibacterial compound yohimbine.<\/br> Conclusions: This work provides the first insight into the mechanism of action of yerba mate extract on S. Typhimurium by revealing a major impact on central carbon metabolism, catalase activity, and possible metabolic links to interference in energy production and membrane integrity. The putative identification of the antibacterial compound yohimbine and the many unidentified compounds provides additional avenues for future investigations of novel yerba mate compounds capable of traversing or binding to S. Typhimurium\u2019s membrane.","Sample collection: Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 strain 2576 was obtained from the Department of Food Science and Technology at the University of Tennessee. Stock cultures of S. Typhimurium strains were stored in 25% glycerol at -20 \u00b0C. Cultures were started from frozen stocks and re-inoculated daily in tryptic soy broth (TSB) for 2-3 days before an experiment. To score the CFUs at a given time interval, 100 \u03bcl samples were serially diluted in 0.1% sterile peptone and pour-plated in duplicate using tryptic soy agar (TSA). S. Typhimurium plates were grown aerobically at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. Following incubation, CFUs were enumerated. Yerba mate extract (80 mg\/ml) was reconstituted in MOPS buffer pH 7.3, adjusted to a final pH of 7.3 with 1 M KOH, and syringe-filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm Express PES Membrane (Millipore, Billerica, Ma., USA) prior to microbial susceptibility testing. All growth experiments were performed in 125 ml flasks containing 12.5 ml TSB, 10 ml reconstituted yerba mate extract or MOPS buffer pH 7.3, and 2.5 ml S. Typhimurium for a total volume of 25 ml. 5 ml of ca. 20 h culture was pelleted at 15,000 g for 1 min at 4 \u00b0C, the supernatant decanted, and the pellet resuspended in 5 ml PBS to achieve a ca. 9 log(CFU\/ml) starting concentration. 2.5 ml PBS was substituted for bacteria in a no-bacteria control and MOPS pH 7.3 buffer was substituted for yerba mate extract in a no-tea control. Experiments were conducted aerobically at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 150 rpm. At times 0, 40 min, and 4 h, 500 \u03bcl of cells were removed.","Extraction: The 500 \u03bcl of cells sampled at 3 time points were immediately diluted in 4.5 ml PBS, mixed, and vacuum filtered with 0.4 \u03bcm polycarbonate filters. The filters were placed face-down in 1.3 ml cold (20 \u00b0C) extraction solvent (4:4:2 AcN:MeOH:H2O) for 20 min at 20 \u00b0C. In a 4 \u00b0C cold room, any remaining cells were washed from the filter with 400 \u03bcl extraction solvent and pelleted at 13,000 rpm for 5 min. All extraction solvent fractions for a single sample were combined, dried under flowing nitrogen, resuspended in 300 \u03bcl of milliQ water, and transferred to a centrifuge tube. 6 biological replicates were done, but contamination found in CFU plates prompted the exclusion of 3 replicates.","Chromatography: All samples were randomized in a 4 \u02daC autosampler tray, from which 10 ul aliquots were injected into a Synergi 2.5 micron Hydro-RP 100, 100 x 2.00 mm liquid chromatography column (Phenomenex) maintained at 25 \u02daC. A gradient across solvents A (97:3 water:methanol, 10 mM tributylamine, and 15 mM acetic acid ) and B (methanol) was run with 0% B for 5 min, 20% B for 8 min, 55% B for 2.5 min, 95% B for 3.5 min, and finally 0% B for 6 min using a 200 \u00b5l\/min flow rate.","Mass spec: The column eluted to an electrospray ionization (ESI) source coupled to a mass spectrometer by a 0.1 mm internal diameter fused silica capillary tube.

","Data transformation: Data was converted from Thermo .raw files to .mzML using msconvert from ProteoWizard. Peak selection was done with Maven version 767 using the default model. Parameters for peak selection were: mass domain resolution of 5 ppm, time domain resolution of 10 scans, EIC smoothing of 3 scans, peak grouping of 0.5 min, drop 80% intensities to get baseline, baseline smoothing of 10 scans, 3 minimum good peaks, minimum signal\/baseline ration of 5, minumum peak width of 10 scans, minimum signal\/blank ration of 5, and minimum peak intensity of 10000 ions. Peak intensity data in the resulting data matrix was normalized to biomass by scaling the intensity for each sample. All samples were arbitrarily scaled to the intensity value of the first sample (7.35 \u00d7 108 CFU\/ml counts). To investigate treatment and time differences, the data matrix was analyzed as a randomized block design, blocked on replicate, with split plots of time. A split plot analysis was considered sufficient when the change in Akaike information criterion (AIC) was less than 3 between a repeated measures model with an adjusted correlation structure (AR1) and a split plot model without a defined correlation structure. In 131 of the 7693 untargeted metabolites that were normal and had equal variance, the change in AIC was greater than 3, so a repeated measures correlation structure was used in those cases. The 3 flask treatments were control_no_tea (0 mg\/ml yerba mate extract with S. Typhimurium), tea (80 mg\/ml yerba mate extract with S. Typhimurium), and control_no_bacteria (80 mg\/ml yerba mate extract with PBS instead of bacteria). ANOVA assumptions were tested in R with the Levene test for equal variance (P>0.05) and the Shapiro-Wilks test for normality (W>0.80). If these assumptions were not met or if errors occurred in the lme analysis (i.e. \u201ccomputationally singular matrix\u201d), metabolites were not included in the analysis. Otherwise, data were analyzed using linear mixed models (package nlme, R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). P-values were collected from a Tukey\u2019s honestly significant differences (HSD) analysis implemented with the R glht function from the multcomp package. Tukey HSD p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Benjamini-Hochberg method (false discovery rate 0.05, R function p.adjust) as a single family across all metabolites. ANOVA p-values across treatments were adjusted with the Benjamini-Hochberg correction as a separate group across all metabolites. Metabolites with an ANOVA p-value of P< 0.05 across all treatments that additionally had a Tukey HSD contrast p-value of P<0.05 were ranked by the most positive to most negative fold-change in the results tables.","Metabolite id: Metabolites were identified based on an in-house library of 260 compounds that had been run as pure standards on the same instrument and with the same methods used for the samples.

Here, the effect of propranolol on P. putida was examined by sudden addition of 0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg\/ml of this \u03b2-blocker to several strains of P. putida, including the wild type DOT-T1E and the efflux pump knockout mutants DOT-T1E-PS28 and DOT-T1E-18. Bacterial viability measurements reveal that the efflux pump TtgABC plays a more important role than the TtgGHI pump in strain tolerance to propranolol. Mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy was then used as a rapid, high-throughput screening tool to investigate any phenotypic changes resulting from exposure to varying levels of propranolol. Multivariate statistical analysis of these MIR data revealed gradient trends in resultant ordination scores plots, which were related to the concentration of propranolol. MIR illustrated phenotypic changes associated with the presence of this drug within the cell that could be assigned to significant changes that occurred within the bacterial protein components. To complement this phenotypic fingerprinting approach metabolic profiling was performed using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify metabolites of interest during the growth of bacteria following toxic perturbation with the same concentration levels of propranolol. Metabolic profiling revealed that ornithine, which was only produced by P. putida cells in the presence of propranolol, presents itself as a major metabolic feature that has important functions in propranolol stress tolerance mechanisms within this highly significant and environmentally relevant species of bacteria.","Sample collection: 1. Bacterial strains and cultivation of bacteria: Three bacterial strains of P. putida DOT-T1E were used in this study. All strains were sub-cultured in triplicate to obtain axenic cultures. Individual colonies were then picked and transferred from plates into 250 ml flasks containing 50 ml of autoclaved Lysogeny broth (LB) medium and incubated at 24 h at 30 \u00b0C in an orbital incubator (Infors HT Ltd, UK) shaking at 200 rpm.  2. Growth in response to propranolol shock, sample collection and analysis: Cells were grown in 50 ml of LB medium for 5 h at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm. Once cell cultures reached the mid-exponential phase, samples were divided into two groups. One group was kept as a control, and to the second group propranolol was added at three different concentrations (0.2, 0.4 and 0.6 mg\/ml). These cultures were then incubated for an additional 8 h. 3. Sample collection and quenching: 15 ml samples were quenched at three time points 0, 10 and 60 min before and after the addition of propranolol (0 min refers to the point immediately before the addition of propranolol). This procedure was performed with four biological replicates. ","Extraction: Generally, a rapid inactivation of metabolism is achieved by alteration in pH or temperature . Thus, in order to halt metabolism culture samples (15 ml) were plunged into a double volume of 60% cold methanol (-50 \u00b0C) in a 50 ml tube. The quenched culture mixture was centrifuged (3000 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 1 \u00b0C), and then the supernatant was discarded, while the cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C until required for metabolite extraction. The methanol metabolite extraction method was undertaken by suspending the biomass in 750 \u00b5l of 80% cold methanol (-20 \u00b0C) which was transferred to a new 2 ml Eppendorf tube. This was followed by a freeze-thaw cycle in order to extract the intracellular polar metabolites from the cells. Samples were centrifuged at (13500 \u00d7 g, 3 min, 4 \u00b0C) and supernatant transferred to new tubes and stored on dry ice. The extraction was performed again on the remaining pellet and both supernatants were combined and again stored on dry ice. A final aliquot (1400 \u00b5l) of metabolite extracts were normalised using 80% methanol according to OD at 660 nm. A quality control (QC) sample was prepared by transferring 100 \u00b5l from each of the samples to a new (15 ml) centrifuge tube. This was followed by the addition of (100 \u00b5l) of internal standard solution (0.2 mg\/ml glycine-d5, 0.2 mg\/ml benzoic-d5 acid, 0.2 mg\/ml lysine-d4, and 0.2 mg\/ml succinic-d4 acid) to all samples. The samples were lyophilized for 16 h by speed vacuum concentrator (concentrator 5301; Eppendorf, Cambridge, UK), and then the pellet was stored at -80 \u00b0C for further analysis.","Chromatography: Metabolite samples were removed from -80 \u00b0C storage and re-dried for 3 h in a concentrator prior to derivatisation, in order to remove any moisture absorbed by the sample during thawing, which could interfere with derivatisation process. Samples were derivatised for GC-MS following a two stage process as described previously [1]. Briefly, 50 \u00b5l O-methylhdroxylamine hydrochloride solution (20 mg\/ml in pyridine) was added to all samples. The samples were then heated using a heating block at 65 \u00b0C for 40 min followed by addition of 50 \u00b5l of MSTFA (N-methyl-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide) and then heated for 40 min. An aliquot (20 \u00b5l) of retention index solution (C10\/CH12\/C15\/C19\/C22 n-alkanes) was added for chromatographic alignment. The gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS) method was used to analyse the derivatised samples in a random order.

Hence, a novel RP-UHPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS\/MS analytical method was developed employing target, suspect and non-target screening strategies coupled to advanced chemometric tools for the investigation of authenticity of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). The proposed method was successfully applied in real olive oil samples for the identification of markers responsible for its sensory profile. The proposed target analytical method includes the determination of 14 phenolic compounds and demonstrated low limits of detection (LODs) over the range of 0.015 (apigenin) - 0.039 (vanillin) \u03bcg\/ml and adequate recoveries (96-107%). A suspect list of 60 relevant compounds was compiled and suspect screening was then applied to all the samples. Semi-quantitation of the suspect compounds was performed using the calibration curves of the target compounds having similar structures. Then, a non-target screening workflow was applied with the aim to identify additional compounds, responsible to differentiate EVOOs from defective oils. Robust classification-based models were built using supervised discrimination techniques, PLS-DA and CP-ANNs, for the classification of olive oils into EVOOs or defectives. Variance in Projection (VIP) was calculated to select the most significant features that affect the discrimination. Overall, 51 compounds were identified and suggested as markers; 14, 26 and 11 compounds were identified using target, suspect and non-target screening, respectively. Retrospective analysis was also performed to identify 19 free fatty acids.","Extraction: A liquid-liquid micro-extraction (LLME) method was employed for isolating the phenolic compounds from the olive oil samples as was developed and validated by Becerra-Herrera et al [1]. Each sample was weighed (0.5 g) and 0.5 ml of methanol : water (80:20, v\/v) was added in 2 ml Eppendorf tubes. Afterwards, the mixture was vortexed for 2 mins, and centrifuged for 5 mins at 13,400 rpm. The upper phase that consisted of methanol was collected and filtered through the membrane syringe filters of regenerated cellulose (CHROMAFIL\u00ae RC) (15 mm diameter, 0.22 \u03bcm pore size, provided by Macherey-Nagel (D\u00fcren, Germany). Two hundred microliters of the methanolic phase was diluted with ultrapure water to 0.5 ml. Finally, 5 \u03bcl of this solution was injected in the chromatographic system. Procedural blanks were also prepared and processed in the chromatographic system to detect any potential contamination. Quality Control (QC) samples were used in order to verify that the analytical system has been stabilized prior to analysis of the main batch of samples and assess its performance. A typical QC sample was prepared, as it has been suggested by Want et al. [2] by mixing all aliquots of the samples. In the beginning of the analysis, the QC was injected five times for conditioning and afterwards, it was injected at regular intervals (i.e. every ten sample injections) throughout the analytical run to provide a set of data from which repeatability can be assessed. \u03a4he calculated RSD values for the tR and the peak areas as well as \u0394m errors (n=7) are presented in Electronic Supplementary Material of the associated study paper (Section S2, Table S2) proving the good performance of the analytical system.

Separation was carried out using an Acclaim RSLC C18 column (2.1 \u00d7 100 mm, 2.2 \u00b5m) purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientific (Driesch, Germany) with a pre-column of ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 (1.7 \u03bcm, VanGuard Pre-Column, Waters (Ireland)). The separation was operated at column temperature of 30 \u00b0C. The solvents used consisted of: (A) 90% H2O, 10% MeOH and 5 mM CH3COONH4, (B) 100% MeOH and 5 mM CH3COONH4. The adopted elution gradient started with 1% of organic phase B (flow rate 0.2 ml\/min) during one minute, gradually increasing to 39% for the next 2 mins, and then increasing to 99.9% (flow rate 0.4 ml\/min) in the following 11 mins. These almost pure organic conditions were kept constant for 2 mins (flow rate 0.48 ml\/min) and then initial conditions (1% B - 99% A) were restored within 0.1 min (flow rate decreased to 0.2 ml\/min) to re-equilibrate the column for the next injection.","Mass spec: The Q-TOF MS (Maxis Impact, Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) system was equipped with an electrospray ionization interface (ESI), operating in negative mode with the following settings: capillary voltage of 3500 V; end plate offset of 500 V; nebulizer pressure of 2 bar (N2); drying gas of 8 l\/min (N2); and drying temperature of 200 \u00b0C. A Q-TOF external calibration was daily performed with a sodium formate cluster solution, and a segment (0.1\u22120.25 min) in every chromatogram was used for internal calibration, using a calibrant injection at the beginning of each run. The sodium formate calibration mixture consisted of 10 mM sodium formate in a mixture of water\/isopropanol (1:1). Full scan mass spectra were recorded over the range of 50-1000 m\/z, with a scan rate of 2 Hz. MS\/MS experiments were conducted using AutoMS data dependent acquisition mode based on the fragmentation of the five most abundant precursor ions per scan. For certain masses of interest, if the intensity of the m\/z was low, a second analysis including the list of the selected precursor ions was carried out in AutoMS (data dependent acquisition) mode. The instrument provided a typical resolving power (FWHM) between 36,000-40,000 at m\/z 226.1593, 430.9137 and 702.8636.","Data transformation: In order to process LC-HRMS data, first of all, binary files of all the analysed samples were converted to mzXML files using Proteowizard software [1]. Then, these files were processed using the R-language and the XCMS package [2] to extract peaks that are present in the samples. This procedure involved peak picking by CentWave algorithm [2], grouping of peaks representing the same analyte across the samples and a step to correct the chromatographic drift of retention time. The next step was to regroup the peaks of which the retention time was changed. At final step, a step of filling in the missing peaks was implemented. This replaces the missing values of none detected peaks with a small value of intensity [3]. CAMERA package was also used to deisotoping and removing the adduct peaks to avoid co-linearity during the model construction [4].

The impact of individual compounds as either growth substrates or infochemicals is still poorly constrained in models, particularly for organisms with relatively versatile genomes. Here, we use metabolomics techniques to characterize the response of a heterotrophic marine bacterium, Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3, to growth on the abundant algal metabolite dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP). DMSP is a valuable source of reduced carbon and sulfur as well as a chemo-attractant. It is present at higher concentrations during phytoplankton blooms. When cultivated on DMSP, R. pomeroyi synthesized a quorum sensing molecule, N-(3-oxotetradecanoyl)-L-homoserine lactone, which was not synthesized at the same levels during growth on propionate, another carbon substrate. More broadly, we observed differential production of intra- and extracellular metabolites with implications for nitrogen assimilation and microbial cross-feeding. This multi-faceted response suggests that R. pomeroyi uses a two-component regulatory system dependent on the presence of DMSP and high cell densities to activate a suite of metabolic changes that may shape how it accesses nutrients and impacts the surrounding microbial consortium.","Sample collection: Ruegeria pomeroyi DSS-3 [DSM 15171] was purchased from ATCC (Catalog #700808). The bacteria were grown in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks with glass wool in the neck in the dark at 23 \u02daC. At each time point two duplicate flasks were sacrificed for both treatments. Media blanks (\"cell-free controls\") for each substrate were extracted at 0, 40, and 72 hours. The defined media (total volume = 120 ml) was made with 0.2 \u03bcm-filtered seawater collected near high tide from Vineyard Sound (Massachusetts) in September 2013. Nutrients and carbon substrates were added to the media in the concentrations in the following concentrations:Sodium propionate(1 mM = 3 mM C), dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP, 0.6 mM = 3 mM C), NH4Cl (6 g\/25 ml), NaH2PO4 (36.2 mM), f\/2 Vitamins Solution (2.34 ml added for 2.34 l of media), FeCl2-EDTA (0.1 M), ZnCl2 (0.001 M), MnCl2 (0.001 M), CoCl2 (0.1 mM). The experimental samples were inoculated with exponentially-growing R. pomeroyi that had been pre-conditioned in the target media (two transfers). Cultures were sacrificed at 0, 32, 38(p)\/43(d), 48, 60, and 72 hours. The third time point was offset between the propionate and DMSP treatments so that the same cell abundance was sampled in each treatment. These time points captured exponential and stationary growth phases in both experiments. Each culture was filtered through a 0.2 \u00b5m filter (Omnipore, EMD Millipore) using a glass vacuum filtration rig.","Extraction: Intracellular Metabolite Extraction (adapted from [1])Filters were placed in cryovials and frozen at -80 \u00b0C immediately after filtration. Subsequently, three quarters of each filter was weighed and cut into small pieces with methanol rinsed scissors on combusted aluminum foil. The pieces of the filter were placed in an 8 ml combusted amber glass vial and 1 ml of -20 \u00b0C 40:40:20 acetonitrile:methanol:water + 0.1 M formic acid was added to each vial. 25 \u00b5l of 1 \u00b5g\/ml deuterated standard mix (d3-glutamic acid, d4-4-hydroxybenzoic acid, and d5-taurocholate) were added to act as extraction recovery standards. The vials were vortexed to shake apart filter pieces and fully expose them to the ice-cold solvent. They were sonicated for 10 minutes and the extract was transferred to micro-centrifuge tubes using Pasteur pipettes. The filter pieces were rinsed with 200 \u00b5l of extraction solvent and the rinse was added to the eppendorf tubes as well. The extracts were centrifuged at 20,000 \u00d7 g for 5 minutes. The supernatant was transferred to new 8 ml amber glass vials leaving behind any scraps of filter or pieces of cellular detritus. The extracts were neutralized with 26 \u00b5l of 6 M ammonium hydroxide and dried down in a vacufuge. The samples were reconstituted in 495 \u00b5l 95:5 water:acetonitrile and 5 \u00b5l of 5 \u00b5g\/ml deuterated biotin (injection standard). The solution (100 \u00b5l) was placed in a glass insert in an autosampler vial for targeted metabolomic analysis. From this same solution 250 \u00b5l was removed and placed in a new vial, dried down, and brought up 500 \u00b5l 0.01 M HCl. The solution was pulled through a 50 mg Varian PPL cartridge that was pre-rinsed with 1 ml methanol. The cartridge was rinsed with 2 ml 0.01 M HCl, dried for five minutes by pulling air through the cartridge, and then the sample was eluted from the cartridge with 1 ml methanol. The samples were dried down in a vacufuge and reconstituted in 250 \u00b5l of 95:5 water:acetonitrile for untargeted analysis. Extracellular Metabolite ExtractionThe media filtrate was acidified to pH 2-3 with 12 M HCl. It was then pulled through a methanol-rinsed 50 mg Varian PPL (styrene divinyl benzene polymer) cartridge. The cartridge was rinsed with 2 ml 0.01 M HCl, and the metabolites were eluted with 1 ml methanol (adapted from [2]). It was dried down in a vacufuge and reconstituted to a total volume of 1 ml as the targeted intracellular samples were above. Ref: [1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

","Chromatography: All samples were pre-separated with the same liquid chromatography method on a Synergi 4 \u00b5m Fusion \u2013 RP 80 \u00c5, 150 \u00d7 2.00 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA). Eluents were (A) Milli-Q water with 0.1% formic acid and (B) acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid. The gradient included: hold at 5% B for 2 minutes; ramp to 65% B for 16 minutes; ramp to 100% B for 7 minutes and hold for 8 min. The column was re-equilibrated for 8.5 min in between analyses.","Mass spec: Untargeted analyses were conducted using a hybrid linear ion trap - 7T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR-MS; LTQ FT Ultra, Thermo Scientific) with an electrospray ionization source. The instrument is externally calibrated weekly with a standard mix from the manufacturer. In parallel to the high resolution full MS scan in the FT-ICR cell (R = 100,000 defined at 400 m\/z), the top four most abundant ions that exceeded 500 counts in the ion trap were fragmented. For the intracellular analysis, between every six samples the following sequence was run: Milli-Q blank, standard mix quality control, Milli-Q blank, two pooled samples (one for conditioning and one for feature validation). The targeted method used a Thermo Scientific triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with a heated electrospray ionization source. A mixture containing the standards for all of the targeted metabolites was run at 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng\/ml concentrations. For the extracellular samples a 500 ng\/ml standard mix was run approximately every six samples as quality control with a Milli-Q blank run before and after. In the intracellular samples a pooled sample of all the experimental samples was run after the second Milli-Q sample to re-condition the column.","Data transformation: The untargeted data was processed using XCMS [1][2][3] and CAMERA [4]. Peak picking and alignment were carried out separately for the intracellular and extracellular samples. The files were converted from Thermo RAW files to mzML files using MSConvert [5]. In negative ion mode the peak threshold was set to an absolute intensity of 1000 in MSConvert before processing in XCMS. XCMS settings included: method = centWave, ppm = 2 (negative ion mode), 3 (positive ion mode), signal-to-noise = 10. The retention time correction setting and group.density were also used. Fragmentation mass spectra had a signal-to-noise threshold of 1. For the intracellular samples, pooled samples were used as an additional quality control. The average of each feature in the pooled samples or the experimental samples had to be greater than 1000. The coefficient of variance (100*standard deviation of feature\/mean of feature) for each feature in the experimental samples and the pooled samples was calculated and only features that had a higher coefficient of variance in the experimental samples than in the pooled samples were retained for consideration [6]. The list of features defined by a retention time and mass-to-charge ratio was further refined by removing any features found in the samples whose average was less than five times higher than the average of all the media blanks. In addition, features had to be present in both biological replicates at two different sampling points. This accounted for compounds that might be found in the seawater but were also being produced by the bacteria. To compare overall differences in metabolite composition in the samples, non-metric multidimensional scaling using Bray-Curtis distances was used. The targeted data was processed using Xcalibur (Thermo Scientific software). Standard curves were assessed individually and low quality peaks removed. The media controls were subtracted from the intracellular samples and used as a starting point reference for the extracellular samples. Ref: [1] Smith CA, Want EJ, O'Maille G, Abagyan R, Siuzdak G.

However, the in vitro cell culture conditions under which much cellular metabolism research is performed differ drastically from in vivo tumor conditions, which are characterized by variations in the levels of oxygen, nutrients like glucose, and other molecules like chemotherapeutics. Moreover, it is important to know how the diverse cell types in a tumor, including cancer stem cells that are believed to be a major cause of cancer recurrence, respond to these variations. Here, in vitro environmental perturbations designed to mimic different aspects of the in vivo environment were used to characterize how an ovarian cancer cell line and its derived, isogenic cancer stem cells metabolically respond to environmental cues. Mass spectrometry was used to profile metabolite levels in response to in vitro environmental perturbations. Docetaxel, the chemotherapeutic used for this experiment, caused significant metabolic changes in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism in ovarian cancer cells, but had virtually no metabolic effect on isogenic ovarian cancer stem cells. Glucose deprivation, hypoxia, and the combination thereof altered ovarian cancer cell and cancer stem cell metabolism to varying extents for the two cell types. Hypoxia had a much larger effect on ovarian cancer cell metabolism, while glucose deprivation had a greater effect on ovarian cancer stem cell metabolism. Core metabolites and pathways affected by these perturbations were identified, along with pathways that were unique to cell types or perturbations. The metabolic responses of an ovarian cancer cell line and its derived isogenic cancer stem cells differ greatly under most conditions, suggesting that these two cell types may behave quite differently in an in vivo tumor microenvironment. While cancer metabolism and cancer stem cells are each promising potential therapeutic targets, such varied behaviors in vivo would need to be considered in the design and early testing of such treatments.","Sample collection: The OVCAR-3 cell line was obtained from the Developmental Therapeutic Program (DTP) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer cells (OCCs) were cultured in R10 medium: RPMI-1640 (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA). Authenticity of the OVCAR-3 cell line was confirmed using short tandem repeat profiling performed by IDEXX RADIL (Columbia, MO) in October 2013. Cells were grown until confluence and subcultured at a ratio of 1:4. Ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs) previously derived from a side population of OVCAR-3 were cultured in ultra-low attachment petri dishes (Corning Incorporated, Corning, NY) in stem cell medium: DMEM\/F12 (1:1) (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA) supplemented with 0.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 20 ng\/ml epidermal growth factor (EGF, Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY), 10 ng\/ml basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), 5 \u03bcg\/ml insulin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 1% antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Cellgro, Mediatech Inc., Manassas, VA). The spheroids were dissociated and reseeded at a density of 105 cells\/ml each week. For these experiments, there was one chemotherapeutic (docetaxel) and three environmental perturbations (glucose deprived, hypoxia, and ischemia). For the chemotherapeutic perturbation, samples were taken at 0 min, 24 hr, and 48 hr. For the hypoxic and glucose deprived perturbation, samples were taken at 0 min, 2 hr, 4 hr, 8 hr, 24 hr, and 48 hr. For ovarian cancer cells (OCCs), medium was removed and cells were quickly washed with 1 ml PBS at 37 \u00b0C, which was aspirated off, and then 700 \u00b5l of 80:20 methanol\/water solution at -80 \u00b0C was added immediately. The plate was then incubated at -80 \u00b0C for 15 min. After incubation, remaining cellular debris were harvested using a cell scraper (BD Falcon, San Jose, CA) for intracellular analysis. For ovarian cancer stem cells (OCSCs), the media-cell mixture was transferred to a filter cup (Microcheck II beverage monitor, Pall, Port Washington, NY) with a pre-wetted membrane (0.45 \u00b5m pore Express PLUS Polyethersulfone membrane, Millipore, Billerica, MA) and the medium was filtered from the cells. The cells were then quickly washed with 4 ml PBS at 37 \u00b0C. The filter was then removed and placed upside down in a petri dish containing 1.5 ml of 80:20 methanol\/water solution at -80 \u00b0C. The samples were then incubated at -80 \u00b0C for 15 min. After 15 min, the petri dish was removed and the filter was flipped over and washed using the 1.5 ml 80:20 methanol\/water solution to remove any debris still caught in the filter. An extraction blank was made for the OCSCs following the same procedure above but only 4 ml PBS was washed through the filter. For both cell types, the intracellular solution was then transferred to a microcentrifuge tube in a cold ethanol bath and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 5 min at -4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was retained, and the pellet was subsequently re-extracted twice in 100 \u00b5l of the cold 80:20 methanol\/water solution, with all supernatants being pooled. Intracellular and extracellular samples were stored at -80 \u00b0C and -20 \u00b0C, respectively, until analysis.","Extraction: Before derivatization, intracellular samples were vacuum concentrated in a CentriVap at 40 \u00b0C until completely dry. Samples were aliquoted so as to be already normalized to cell count: cell density at sample time had been measured on a hemacytometer, and the volume that was vacuum concentrated was varied for each sample in order to yield a final concentration of 3,000 live cell equivalents\/\u00b5l after derivatization. The samples were derivatized by using the following protocol. 2.5 \u00b5l of 40 mg\/ml O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Santa Ana, CA) in pyridine was added to the dried sample and shaken at 1400 rpm for 90 minutes at 30 \u00b0C. 22.5 \u00b5l of N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) + 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) (Thermo Scientific, Lafayette, CO) was then added to the samples which were then shaken at 1400 rpm for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Samples were centrifuged at 21,100 x g for 3 min and 10 \u00b5l of the supernatant was added to an autosampler vial. Samples were spiked with 0.10 \u00b5l of a retention time standard solution consisting of fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) and an internal standard of nonadecanoic acid methyl ester dissolved in dimethylformamide.","Chromatography: A LECO Pegasus 4D instrument with an Aglient 7683B autosampler, Agilent 7890A gas chromatograph and time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) was used to analyze the samples. The instrument was controlled using ChromaTOF. A sample volume of 1 \u00b5l was injected into the split\/splitless inlet at 250 \u00b0C in splitless mode. The first column was an HP-5, 30 m long x 0.320 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), and the second was an Rtx-200, 2 m long x 0.25 mm ID x 0.25 \u00b5m film thickness (Restek, Bellefonte, PA) with a constant flow rate of 1.00 ml\/min helium. The initial oven temperature was set to 70 \u00b0C and was held for one min after which the temperature was increased at 10 \u00b0C\/min until reaching 315 \u00b0C with a final hold for two min.","Mass spec: A LECO Pegasus IV D time of flight mass spectrum (TOF-MS) was used. The total MS method time was based on the GC method time with an acquisition delay of 240 s. The collection mass range was from 50 to 500 u. The acquisition rate was set to 200 spectra\/second. The detector voltage was set to 100 V above the optimized voltage with the electron energy set to -70 V. The mass defect mode was set to manual with the mass defect 0 mu\/100 u. The transfer line temperature was set to 320 \u00b0C and the ion source temperature was set to 220 \u00b0C.","Data transformation: Sample files were first analyzed in ChromaTOF (LECO, St. Joseph, MI) to determine baseline, peak area, and peak identification. Briefly, settings included a baseline offset of 0.5, automatic smoothing, 1st dimension peak width of 24 s, 2nd dimension peak width of 0.10 s, and a match of 700 required to combine peaks with a minimum signal-to-noise (S\/N) of 5 for all subpeaks. Peaks were required to have a S\/N of 10 and have a minimum similarity score of 800 before assigning a name. Unique mass was used for area and height calculation. Analytes were then aligned across the sample files using MetPP (http:\/\/metaopen.sourceforge.net\/metpp.html). After alignment, further processing of the data was done based on the procedure laid out in [1]. Batch effects were removed from the intracellular data set using LOESS. To remove analytes that were not reproducibly detected, analytes for which more than half of the values were missing in the QC samples or for which the QC samples had a coefficient of variance larger than 0.5 were removed from the data set. Then, missing values were manually corrected using small value correction only if all the values were missing in the biological replicate. Analysis of final data set was performed using MetaboAnalyst (http:\/\/metaboanalyst.ca\/).

In this study, we extended the natural variation approach by including biological variability and analyzed root metabolic patterns as well as their variability between plants and naturally occurring accessions. <p\/> To screen 19 accessions of A. thaliana, comprehensive non-targeted metabolite profiling of single plant root extracts was performed using UPLC\/ESI-QTOF-MS and GC\/EI-QMS. 98 (GC\/MS) and 139 (LC\/MS) metabolites were identified at MSI levels one or two, or characterised ad level three. <p\/> All metabolic profiles indicated that plant-to-plant-variability is greater than natural variation between accessions and non-biological variation of experimental batches. Ratios of plant-to-plant to total variability were high and distinct for the classes of known secondary metabolites, which are commonly subjected to natural variation analysis. None of the investigated accessions displayed a specifically high or low biological variability for these substance classes.","Sample collection: Seeds of the accession Bur-0, Col-0, Can-0, Ct-1, Edi-0, Hi-0, Kn-0, Ler-0, Mt-0, No-0, Oy-0, Po-0, Rsch-4, Sf-2, Tsu-0, Wil-2, Ws-0, Wu-0, and Zu-0 of Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained from the European Arabidopsis Stock Centre and surface sterilized prior to plant cultivation. Then, all accessions were cultivated in a hydroponic system with three independent biological experiments. For hydroponic cultivation, a pre- and main culture set-up was used. The pre-culture system consisted of PCR tubes filled with approx. 170 \u00b5l agar solution (8% (w\/v) GELRITE, 1% (w\/v) sucrose) placed in a yellow pipette tip box. After solidification, bottoms were cut and individual seeds were sown on a total of 48 tubes, submerged partially in nutrient solution (half-strength Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with 1% (w\/v) sucrose and Gamborg\u2019s B-5 vitamins (Duchefa), pH 5.8). Boxes were closed with their lids and sealed with leucoplast (Duchefa). Plants were grown at 22 \u00b0C under short-day conditions (8 h light, 130 \u00b5mol\/m2\/s) to prevent early inflorescences until all roots had penetrated the agar plug. After three weeks, the main-culture system was set up. Tubes were transferred into perforated screw caps of 50ml amber bottles (Duran, Wertheim\/Germany) filled with approximately 70 ml nutrient solution. Modified MS medium (1.0 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.25 mM K2SO4, 0.25 mM CaCl2, 2 mM NH4-NO3, 0.1 mM Na-Fe-EDTA, 50 \u00b5M KCl, 30 \u00b5M H3BO3, 5 \u00b5M MnSO4,1 \u00b5M ZnSO4, 1 \u00b5M CuSO4, 0.7 \u00b5M NaMoO4, pH 5.8) was used as a culturing medium to enable plant growth over a prolonged period without osmotic stress and sufficient nutrient supply. Medium was exchanged weekly accompanied by a check for microbial contamination after harvest. Glass bottles were kept in sealed plastic boxes (Araponics, Li\u00e8ge\/Belgium) with 12 plants each. This experimental setup resulted in 228 root samples from individual plants. Single-plant roots were harvested at week 6 and homogenized in liquid nitrogen using a pestle and mortar, resulting in 222 and 210 usable root samples for LC\/MS and GC\/MS analysis, respectively.

The purpose of this research was to study differences in oxylipin levels between a widely used collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice model and healthy control (Ctrl) mice. DBA\/1J male mice (age: 6-7 weeks) were selected and randomly divided into two groups, viz. a CIA- and a Ctrl group. The CIA mice were injected intraperitoneal (i.p.) with the joint cartilage component collagen type II (CII) and an adjuvant injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Oxylipin metabolites were extracted from plasma for each individual sample using solid phase extraction (SPE) and were detected with high performance liquid chromatography\/tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS\/MS), using dynamic multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM). Both univariate and multivariate statistical analysis was applied. The results in univariate student's t-test revealed 10 significantly up- or down-regulated oxylipins in CIA mice, which were supplemented by another 6 additional oxylipins, contributing to group clustering upon multivariate analysis. The dysregulation of these oxylipins revealed the presence of ROS-generated oxylipins and an increase of inflammation in CIA mice. The results also suggested that the Collagen-induced arthritis might associate with dysregulation of apoptosis, possibly inhibited by activated NF- \u03ba B because of insufficient PPAR-\u03b3 ligands.","Sample collection: 20 DBA\/1J male mice (6\u20137 weeks; Charles River Laboratories) were randomly divided in 2 groups (10 in CIA group, 10 in Ctrl group as healthy control). In the CIA group, immunization with collagen type II will provoke chronic polyarthritis by the induced autoimmune response. Each mouse was intraperitoneal induced (i.p.) with joint cartilage component collagen type II (CII; 100 \u00b5g diluted with a 100 \u00b5l volume 0.005 M acetic acid) which was extracted from bovine nasal cartilage (Funakoshi Co., Tokyo, Japan) at day 0 (T=0). Thereafter, the CII injection was repeated i.p. on days 14, 28, 42 and 56. In the ctrl mice, 100 \u00b5l of 0.005 M acetic acid alone was administered i.p. on the same days (0, 14, 28, 42 and 56). Next, to all experimental mice, 5 mg of Lipopolysaccharide from E. coli 011:B4 (Chondrex, Redmond, USA) dissolved in 100 \u00b5l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was given i.p. immediately after each injection of CII. In the ctrl group, 100 \u00b5l PBS was similarly administered as a control. All animals were maintained in a temperature and light controlled environment with free access to standard rodent chow and water. From day 71 to day 75, blood was taken from each animal of both groups and collected in pre-cooled tubes containing EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) as co-agulant (BD Vacutainer, Plymouth, UK). After centrifugation at 3000 x g for 10 min, the EDTA-plasma was collected and aliquots were stored at -80 \u00baC until further processing. 50 \u00b5l aliquot of mouse plasma was used for the oxylipins study.","Extraction: Antioxidant mixture (5 \u00b5l) (0.4 mg\/ml BHT and 0.4 mg\/ml EDTA mixed with volume ratio 1:1) and a mixture of internal-standard mixtures (ISTDs) (5 \u00b5l, 1000 nM) were added into each 50 \u00b5l aliquot of mouse plasma.

The dried eluate was re-dissolved in 50 \u00b5l acetonitrile\/methanol (50:50 v\/v) and 5 \u00b5l were used for HPLC analysis.","Chromatography: Separation was done by HPLC (Agilent 1290, San Jose, CA, USA) using an Ascentis Express C18 column (2.1 x 150 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m particles; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) with 0.35 ml flow during 28 min gradient.","Mass spec: The HPLC was coupled to electrospray ionization on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent 6490, San Jose, CA, USA). Oxylipins were detected in negative ion mode using dynamic Multiple Reaction Monitoring (MRM).","Data transformation: Peak areas were exported from Mass Hunter software (Agilent Technologies, version B.05.01) and ratios to internal standards were computed (target compounds\/ ISTDs). Subsequently, an in-house developed QC tool was used to correct for instrument drift and batch effects. The reliability of the measurements was assessed by calculating the reproducibility of each metabolite in a QC pool, which was measured after every 10 samples. 30 unique oxylipins out of a target list of 110 oxylipins included in the metabolomics platform met the criteria RSD-QC <35% and were included in the final list for the further statistical analysis. Data were log transformed (Glog) and scaled by the standard deviation (auto-scaling) in order to get a normal distribution.","Metabolite id: MRM transitions were achieved by flow injection of pure standards and the optimizer application and were compared to literature.

Safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.) and tartrazine are among the most common herbal and synthetic foreign materials that may be added to pure saffron for the purpose of adulteration. In spite of encouraging advances achieved in the identification of adulteration in saffron samples, the lack of a simple method with sufficient power for discrimination of pure high grade saffron from meticulously adulterated saffron samples persuaded us to perform this study. Objectives: In this work, we show that 1H NMR spectroscopy together with chemometric multivariate data analysis methods can be used for the detection of adulteration in saffron. Methods: Authentic Iranian saffron samples (n?=?20) and adulterated samples that were prepared by adding either different quantities of natural plant materials such as safflower, or synthetic dyes such as tartrazine or naphthol yellow to pure saffron (n?=?22) composed the training set. This training set was used to build multivariate Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) models. The predictive power of the PLS-DA model was validated by testing the model against an external dataset (n?=?13). Results: PCA and PLS-DA models could both discriminate between the authentic and adulterated samples, and the external validation showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for predicting the authenticity of suspicious samples. Peaks specific to authentic and adulterated samples were also characterized. Proximity of samples with unknown adulteration status to the samples adulterated with known compounds in the PCA provided insight regarding the identity of the adulterant in the suspicious samples. Furthermore, the authentic samples could be distinguished based on their cultivation site. Conclusion: The present study demonstrates that the application of 1H NMR spectroscopy coupled with multivariate data analysis is a suitable approach for detection of adulteration in saffron specimens. Outstanding sensitivity and specificity of the PLS-DA model in discriminating the authentic from adulterated samples in external validation confirmed the high predictive power of the model. The advantage of the present method is its power for detecting a wide spectrum of adulterants, ranging from synthetic dyes to herbal materials, in a single assay.","Sample collection: In total, 20 distinct authentic Iranian saffron samples were collected from reputed providers in Khorasan province, east of Iran. We were able to classify 16 of these samples geographically based on their cultivation sites, to Southern and Northern cultivated samples. 22 adulterated samples were prepared by mixing the pure saffron with different quantities of safflower (purchased from local market branded as \u201cGolrang\u201d), tartrazine or naphthol yellow (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). A separate set of samples was also provided by the Iranian Food and Drug Control Laboratories (FDCL) (n=13). The authenticity of these samples was confirmed by microscopic investigations and information gathered from the food control inspectors. These samples were used as a validation set, and the investigators were blinded to the classification of the samples until the completion of the multivariate analysis.","Extraction: 800 \u00b5l of hot buffered D2O (100 mM KH2PO4, 1 mM 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate (DSS), 10 mM NaN3, pH 7) was added to 20 mg of freshly ground samples using mortar and pestle. After 5 min, the mixtures were centrifuged for 5 min at 10000 rpm and the supernatant collected.","Sample collection: The pH of the supernatant was adjusted to 7 \u00b1 0.05 by adding appropriate acid\/base, if necessary, and 600 \u00b5l of each sample was transferred to 5 mm tubes for NMR spectroscopy.","Nmr spec: Regular one-dimensional proton NMR spectra were obtained using a 500-MHz Bruker Ultrashield NMR spectrometer equipped with a TXI probe (5-mm) (Bruker Biospin, Falanden, Switzerland). Additional 2-dimensional NMR experiments were performed for the purpose of confirming chemical shift assignments, including homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy (2D 1H-1H TOCSY) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (2D 1H-13C HSQC), using standard Bruker pulse programs.","Nmr assay: The spectra were acquired using a standard pulse sequence that had good water suppression characteristics and is commonly used for metabolite profiling of serum samples. Relaxation delay of 1 s was used; t1 was set to 4 \u03bcs and tm had a value of 100 ms. Initial samples for each batch were shimmed to ensure half-height line width of < 1.1 Hz for the dimethyly-silapentane-sulphonate peak, calibrated to 0.0 ppm. Spectra were acquired with 64 scans, then zero filled and Fourier transformed to 128k data points.","Data transformation: After phase and baseline correction using Topspin correction tools, spectral intensities were scaled to DSS and the spectral region \u03b4 = -0.02-10.1 was segmented into bins of 0.04 ppm width. The region of \u03b4 4.70-5.18 ppm was excluded from integration, to eliminate the residual signal of water.","Metabolite id: The pre-processed data was exported to multi-variate statistical analytical software SIMCA-P 14 and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Univariate scaling was applied to overcome the dominating effect of higher intensity metabolite features. Thus scaling gives equal importance to all the components. Logarithmic transformation was also done before analysis to reduce the effect of data skewness. PCA was performed to check the unsupervised segregation of the metabolome. OPLS-DA allowed us to discriminate between the different variables concerning the samples in context. Model significance was assessed using a cross-validated ANOVA with p \u2264 0.05 considered significant. Variables were selected according to the VIP (variable influence on projection) as previously described [1], which are reflective of the correlation of the metabolites towards different response. VIP > 1 was considered significant.[2] Significant metabolites were identified and qualified either by using Chenomx NMR Suite 3.1 Characteristic NMR features of Saffron, Safflower and synthetic dyes software (version 7.5, Edmonton, Alberta, 2013), or were assigned based on literature data [3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10].

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed non-targeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29\u00b14 yr) and 15 elderly (81\u00b17 yr) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV=standard deviation\/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found fourteen blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in anti-oxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson\u2019s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. While our CV values are mostly consistent with those previously published, we here report novel CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4-2.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values such as ATP and glutathione may be related to various diseases as their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences. <\/p> Data from three injections of the same sample and three samples prepared from the same donated blood are available under accession number MTBLS263.

We recently established a suitable experimental system for ESD studies using D. pulex WTN6 strain, in which the sex of the offspring can be regulated simply by alterations in day-length; long-day and short-day conditions can induce female and male offspring respectively. Taking advantage of this system, we have already demonstrated that methyl farnesoate (MF) synthesis is necessary for male offspring production. Further, we identified ionotropic glutamate receptors as an upstream regulator of MF signaling by transcriptome analysis. Despite these findings, the molecular mechanisms associated with MF signaling have not yet been well elucidated in D. pulex. To more comprehensively understand the molecular mechanisms of ESD, we analyzed the whole metabolic profiles of mother daphniids reared under long-day (female-producing) and short-day (male-producing) conditions using mass spectrometry based metabolomics. We discovered that pantothenate (vitamin B5), a known precursor to coenzyme A, was significantly accumulated in response to the short-day condition. To confirm the role of pantothenate in D. pulex ESD, this metabolite was administered to mother daphniids (under long-day conditions) resulting in a significantly increased proportion of male offspring producing mothers. This study not only provides several candidates for further investigations into the molecular changes involved in male offspring production, but also novel insights into the metabolic mechanisms of the ESD system in D. pulex.","Sample collection: The D. pulex WTN6 strain was obtained from the Center for Genomics and Bioinformatics (Indiana University, USA). Animals were maintained in dechlorinated freshwater, which was aerated and filtered through activated carbon for two weeks, at 18 \u00b0C. The water hardness and dissolved oxygen concentration were 60 mg\/l (as CaCO3) and 91.5% as measured by chelatometric titration (Kyoritsu Chemical-check Lab., Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and a dissolved oxygen meter (SevenGo pro SG9, Mettler-Toledo, LLC., Ohio, USA), respectively. A 0.04 ml suspension of 4.3 x 108 cells\/ml Chlorella vulgaris was added daily to each culture of 40 individual daphniids in 2l beakers as a food source. The WTN6 strain was selected for this study as it is possible to induce the production of female or male offspring by rearing under 14 h light:10 h dark or 10 h light:14 h dark conditions, respectively [1]. Each individual daphniid was cultured in 50 ml of freshwater under the long-day or short-day conditions, and then flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen during the critical period for sex determination (50 hours after ovulation) at one month of age (i.e. after ovulating at least 8 times). Three individual animals were combined to form sufficient biomass for one biological replicate, and ten experiments were conducted independently yielding ten biological replicates for each of the two conditions.

Briefly, each frozen sample was homogenized using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogenizer (Stretton Scientific Ltd., UK) in 448 \u03bcl of a 5:2 mixture of methanol: water (both high-performance liquid chromatography [HPLC] grade). Homogenate was then transferred into a 1.8 ml glass vial and further volumes of water (160 \u00b5l) and chloroform (320 \u03bcl) were added to yield a final solvent ratio of 2:2:1.8 methanol: chloroform: water. This mixture was vortex-mixed and centrifuged (4000 x g rcf, 10 min) yielding a biphasic separation. The upper, polar layer of each sample was split evenly (approximately 180 \u00b5l per aliquot) into two 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes for separate mass spectrometric analyses in positive and negative ion modes. The lower, non-polar layer was not used in this study. Polar extracts were dried using a centrifugal concentrator (Thermo Savant, Holbrook, NY, USA) and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to DIMS analysis.

Resuspended samples were centrifuged (22,000 x g rcf, 10 min, 4 \u00b0C) to remove particulate matter. The supernatant of each sample was then loaded as four adjacent technical replicates (5 \u00b5l per well) onto a 384 well plate (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a random order. From the remaining supernatant of each sample, 15 \u00b5l were removed and pooled to generate a quality control sample (QC). All D. pulex samples were analyzed in both ion modes using an LTQ FT Ultra FT-ICR mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) with a direct infusion, chip-based nanoelectrospray ionization source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY, USA). Data was acquired from m\/z 70-590 using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitching methodology [1] in seven SIM windows of 100 m\/z width and 30 m\/z overlap.

With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.","Sample collection: Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in a greenhouse compartment of the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO, Melle, Belgium) and were subjected to normal cultural practices [1]. When tomato plants were 29 weeks old, 108 tomato fruits were collected from 4 tomato plants during a single harvest moment. Considering the days after anthesis (DAA), the harvested tomato fruits were classified into five groups (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), representing various developmental stages. Next, from each group, 10 fruits were selected for analysis. As such, different stages of fruit development and ripening were enclosed, whereby a wide range of carotenoid concentrations and divergent phytohormone profiles were covered. Selection of these fruits was each time realized in such a way that the number of different plants and trusses, from which the fruits originated, was maximized. For each single batch of 10 fruits, at least three different plants and thus at least three different trusses were considered. The consecutive cutting, lyophilization, grinding and sieving of each individual tomato fruit resulted in a homogenous powder, which allowed representative sampling. It should be noted that from the moment that the tomato fruits were harvested, they were kept cold (-20 \u00b0C) and shielded from light in order to prevent degradation of any fruit component.

The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at the high dynamic range (3 x 10^6 ions). Instrument control and data processing were carried out by Xcalibur 2.1 software. Because of the applied full-scan operating principle of this type of mass spectrometer and the associated metabolomic screening possibilities, the phytohormone profiles of the individual tomato fruits could be defined by means of chemometric data analysis. To ensure data quality for metabolomic screening purposes, system stability during analysis was verified by using matrix-matched calibration curves [1]. These curves (6 calibration levels) were set up in early-stage tomato fruit matrix and were run at the beginning and end of the batch of samples.

We applied an optimized, high-throughput membrane-based enzymatic glycan release for small sample amounts. Released glycans were derivatized to stabilize and differentiate between a2,3- and a2,6-linked N-acetylneuraminic acids, followed by N-glycosylation analysis by MALDI-TOF(\/TOF)-MS. Our results showed pronounced differences between the N-glycosylation patterns of CRC cell lines. CRC cell line profiles differed from tissue-derived N-glycan profiles with regard to their high-mannose N-glycan content but showed a large overlap for complex type N-glycans, supporting their use as a glycobiological cancer model system. Importantly, we could show that the high-mannose N-glycans did not only occur as intracellular precursors but were also present at the cell surface. The obtained CRC cell line N-glycan features were not clearly correlated with mRNA expression levels of glycosyltransferases, demonstrating the usefulness of performing the structural analysis of glycans. Finally, correlation of CRC cell line glycosylation features with cancer cell markers and phenotypes revealed an association between highly fucosylated glycans and CDX1 and\/or villin mRNA expression that both correlate with cell differentiation. Together, our findings provide new insights into CRC-associated glycan changes and setting the basis for more in-depth experiments on glycan function and regulation.","Sample collection: Colorectal cancer cell lines were cultured T75 culture flasks in RPMI medium with L-glutamine (LUMC) or DMEM medium (VUmc), supplemented with antibiotics and 10% FCS. Cells were harvested and aliquoted to 2x10^6 cells, washed with PBS and stored at -20 \u00b0C until further use.","Extraction: N-glycans were released with PNGase F from 250 000 cells in quadruplates using a 96-well PVDF-membrane based protocol [1]. Released N-glycans were: i) derivatized by ethyl esterification [2], purified using cotton-HILIC micro-SPE [3] and measured by MALDI-TOF-MS (assay A) and MS\/MS for structural elucidation (LIFT; assay B); ii) labeled with 2-AA [4], purified by cotton-HILIC micro-SPE, and analysed by nano-RP-LC-ESI-ion trap-MS\/MS for glycan fragmentation analysis (assay C).

an effort to identify novel biomarkers capable of predicting the development of acute kidney injury (AKI) after cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) use, urine specimens were collected before and at 4 and 24 hours after surgery from 106 patients and analyzed by means of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and machine learning methods.","Sample collection: In total, 106 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB use at the University Clinic of Erlangen-Nuremberg from July 2009 thru August 2010 were included in this study. Operative procedures included coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), aortic and\/or mitral valve surgery (replacement and repair), combinations of CABG and heart valve surgery, and thoracic aortic surgery. For the determination of SCr levels, serum specimens were collected for each patient on the day before surgery and daily thereafter at 6:00 am. For patient classification according to the AKIN-criteria, SCr levels until the second day after surgery were taken into account. Of the 106 patients, 34 were diagnosed with AKI following surgery. In all five patients that required post-operative RRT, treatment was initiated more than 24 h after surgery. Hence, RRT did not affect metabolite levels in the simultaneously collected urine and plasma specimens. Written declarations of consent had been obtained from all study participants before inclusion. Spot urine samples were collected on the day before surgery, and at 4 and 24 hours after surgery. Urine was centrifuged at 1,500 rpm for 5 min and the clear supernatant was immediately frozen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until NMR analysis. At 24 hours, an additional EDTA-plasma specimen was collected from each patient and stored at -80 \u00b0C.","Extraction: N\/A","Sample collection: For NMR measurements of urine specimens, 400 \u03bcl of urine were mixed with 200 \u03bcl of 0.1 mol\/l phosphate buffer at pH 7.4 and 50 \u03bcl of 29.02 mmol\/l 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionate (TSP) in deuterium oxide as internal standard (Sigma-Aldrich, Taufkirchen, Germany). EDTA-plasma specimens were ultrafiltrated with a cutoff of 10 kD to remove macromolecules and lipids. For subsequent NMR analysis, 400 \u03bcl of the ultrafiltrate were treated as described above.","Nmr spec: NMR experiments were carried out at 298 K on a 600 MHz Bruker Avance III spectrometer (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany).","Nmr assay: A 1D NOESY presaturation pulse sequence was used to analyze the urine samples. For each sample 128 scans were collected into 64k data points using a spectral width of 12.336 kHz (20 ppm) and an acquisition time of 2.66 s per FID.","Data transformation: For equidistant binning, the region from 9.5 to 0.5 ppm of the 1D spectra was evenly split into bins of 0.01-ppm width using Amix 3.9.11 (BrukerBioSpin, Rheinstetten, Germany). After exclusion of the solvent area and the area containing the broad urea signal from 6.5 to 4.5 ppm, 701 bins remained for each 1D spectrum. Signal integrals from each bin were imported into the statistical-analysis software R version 2.14.0. To compensate for global variations in urine concentration caused, for example, by differences in fluid intake, all spectra were normalized prior to analysis by Quantile Normalization to achieve equal distributions of feature intensities across spectra. This approach corrects for dilution effects but preserves differences in concentration of individual metabolites due to other effects. For Quantile Normalization, the functions contained in the R-package affy (http:\/\/cran.r-project.org\/web\/packages\/affy) were used.","Metabolite id: Assignments were obtained by comparison with reference spectra of pure compounds and verified by two dimensional NMR spectroscopy including 1H-13C Heteronuclear Signal Quantum Coherence (HSQC) and 1H-13C Heteronuclear Multiple Bond Correlation (HMBC) Spectroscopy."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS24","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS24","title":"Analysis of human urine reveals metabolic changes related to the development of acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery","date":"2012-10-21","timestamp":1350774000,"submitter":["Wolfram Gronwald"],"publications":[{"title":"Analysis of human urine reveals metabolic changes related to the development of acute kidney injury following cardiac surgery","doi":"10.1007\/s11306-012-0479-4","pubmed":""}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Bruker","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"urine","metabolites":["unidentified","hypoxanthine","Overlap of several compounds","pseudouridine","unidentified|hippuric acid","hippuric acid","phenylacetylglutamine","phenylalanine|unidentified","paracetamol glucuronide","noise","creatinine","myo-inositol","betaine|taurine|trimethylamine-N-oxide","carnitine","acetyl-L-carnitine","2-oxoglutaric acid|carnitine","carnitine|2-oxoglutaric acid|glutamine","L-pyroglutamic acid","3-hydroxyisovaleric acid","acetone","tranexamic acid|N-acetyl-L-glutamine","N-acetyl-groups","N-acetyl-L-groups","tranexamic acid","tranexamic acid|2-hydroxyisobutyric acid"]}},"MTBLS208":{"description":["Drastic alteration in macronutrients causes large changes in gene expression in the photosynthetic unicellular alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Preliminary data suggested that cells follow a biphasic response to this change hinging on the initiation of lipid accumulation, and we hypothesized that drastic repatterning of metabolism also followed this biphasic modality. To test this hypothesis, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolite changes that occur under nitrogen (N) deprivation were analyzed. Eight sampling times were selected covering the progressive slowing of growth and induction of oil synthesis between 4 and 6\u00a0h after N deprivation. Results of the combined, systems-level investigation indicated that C.\u00a0reinhardtii cells sense and respond on a large scale within 30\u00a0min to a switch to N-deprived conditions turning on a largely gluconeogenic metabolic state, which then transitions to a glycolytic stage between 4 and 6\u00a0h after N depletion. This nitrogen-sensing system is transduced to carbon- and nitrogen-responsive pathways, leading to down-regulation of carbon assimilation and chlorophyll biosynthesis, and an increase in nitrogen metabolism and lipid biosynthesis. For example, the expression of nearly all the enzymes for assimilating nitrogen from ammonium, nitrate, nitrite, urea, formamide\/acetamide, purines, pyrimidines, polyamines, amino acids and proteins increased significantly. Although arginine biosynthesis enzymes were also rapidly up-regulated, arginine pool size changes and isotopic labeling results indicated no increased flux through this pathway.","Sample collection: The cell-wall deficient mutant of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CC-400 cw15 mt+, was obtained from the Chlamydomonas Resource Center at the University of Minnesota (St. Paul, MN, USA). The cells were cultured in Tris acetate phosphate (TAP) medium containing 5 mM ammonium chloride as N source at 22 \u00b0C under constant illumination with cool-white fluorescent bulbs at an illumination of 80 \u00b5mol photons\/m^2\/s and with continuous shaking at 150 rpm. Single colonies were used to inoculate a pre-culture in a shake flask plugged with a sponge to allow aeration. This culture was harvested at mid-exponential phase and used to inoculate a new culture at a starting density of around 0.1 OD750, which corresponds to a cell dry weight of 0.05 mg\/ml. The cells were cultured continuously in a volume of 1 l in a 5 l conical flask by serial dilution, not allowing the cell density to exceed 0.4 OD750. The cells were adapted to this environment by at least three serial dilutions corresponding to more than 5 doublings. The culture volume was always equal to or less than one fifth of the flask. This along with the low cell density ensured that the cultures had consistent illumination without significant shading and that the cells remain in a metabolic steady state (confirmed by steady state 13C labelling patterns). After the cells had been adapted to the above conditions, the culture was split in two and harvested by centrifugation (5000 x g for 2 min). One half of the centrifuged cells were washed with acetate-free TAP media and re-suspended in 2 l of fresh TAP media (containing acetate). The remaining cells were washed with acetate free Tris phosphate media without nitrogen source (N-) and re-suspended in 2 l TAP media (with acetate, without N). The cells from each treatment were divided into seven 1 l conical flasks with a culture volume of 200 ml and then allowed to grow under the same conditions described above. The culture was divided into four 50 mL conical tubes and centrifuged immediately at 5000 x g for 2 min at 0 \u00baC for the zero hr time point. Three of the centrifuged pellets were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 \u00baC. The total time from harvest to freezing took less than 10 min. One of the stored pellets was shipped on dry ice for metabolite analysis and another was shipped on dry ice for proteomic analysis. To the fourth pellet, 1 ml of the RNA stabilization reagent, RNAlater (Ambion Life Technologies), was added and then frozen in liquid nitrogen for storage at -70 \u00baC. This sample was sent on dry ice for transcriptome analysis by RNA-seq. The 7 flasks being grown simultaneously were harvested successively after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hr. The culturing and collection process was repeated on four separate occasions (different weeks), to yield four biological replicates. The amount of cells harvested per sample was always more than 4 mg dry weight equivalent.","Extraction: At the incubation site 1 ml cell suspensions were injected into 1 ml of -70 \u00b0C cold quenching solution composed of 70% methanol in water using a thermo block above dry ice. Centrifuge tubes containing the solution during harvest were cooled in a pre-chilled cooling box to keep sample temperature below -20 \u00b0C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at 16,100 rcf for 2 min with the centrifuge and rotor cooled at -20 \u00b0C. Supernatant was decanted and residual liquid carefully removed. The pellet was flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized at -50 \u00b0C in a 2 ml round bottom Eppendorf tube. Lyophilized cells were disrupted using the ball mill MM 301 (Retsch GmbH & Co., Germany) in two variants for 3 min: (a) using 0.5 ml of glass beads (500 \u00b5m i.d., Sigma, St.Louis MO) concomitant with 0.5 ml extraction solvent and (b) using a single 5 mm i.d. steel ball, followed by the addition of 0.5 ml extraction solvent and vortexing. After 2 min centrifugation at 16,100 rcf, the supernatants were removed (200 \u00b5l for the glass bead method, 350 \u00b5l for the steel ball method) followed by a secondary extraction step using an additional 800 \u00b5l extraction solvent, centrifugation and adding the supernatant (700 \u00b5l for the glass bead method) to the first aliquot. Hence, for both methods the same fraction of extraction solvent was used (70% of total extraction volume). 5 different extraction solvent system (methanol:isopropanol:water (5:2:2)) was used. Extracts were concentrated to dryness in a vacuum concentrator. Dried extracts were kept at -80 \u00b0C for up to 4 wks before derivatization and analysis by GC-TOF mass spectrometry.","Chromatography: A mixture of internal retention index markers was prepared using fatty acid methyl esters of C8, C9, C10, C12, C14, C16, C18, C20, C22, C24, C26, C28 and C30 linear chain length, dissolved in chloroform at a concentration of 0.8 mg\/ml (C8-C16) and 0.4 mg\/ml (C18-C30). 2 \u00b5l of this RI mixture were added to the dried extracts. 5 \u00b5l of a solution of 20 mg\/ml of 98% pure methoxyamine hydrochloride (CAS No. 593-56-6, Sigma, St.Louis MO) in pyridine (silylation grade, Pierce, Rockford IL) was added and shaken at 30 \u00b0C for 90 min to protect aldehyde and ketone groups. 45 \u00b5l of MSTFA w\/1% TMCS (1 ml bottles, Pierce, Rockford IL) was added for trimethylsilylation of acidic protons and shaken at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. Reaction mixtures were transferred to 2 ml clear glass autosampler vials with microinserts (Agilent, Santa Clara CA) and closed by 11 mm T\/S\/T crimp caps (MicroLiter, Suwanee GA). 1 \u00b5l sample was filled using 39 mm vial penetration at 1 \u00b5l\/s fill speed, injecting 0.5 \u00b5l at 10 \u00b5l\/s injection speed at initial 50 \u00b0C which was ramped by 12 \u00b0C\/s to final 250 \u00b0C and hold for 3 min. The injector was operated in splitless mode, opening the split vent after 25 s. A 30 m long, 0.25 mm i.d. Rtx-5Sil MS column with 0.25 \u00b5m 95% dimethyl 5% diphenyl polysiloxane film and additional 10 m integrated guard column was used (Restek, Bellefonte PA).","Mass spec: A Leco Pegasus 4D time of flight mass spectrometer was controlled by the Leco ChromaTOF. Electron impact ionization at 70V was employed with an ion source temperature of 250 \u00b0C. After 290 s solvent delay, filament 1 was turned on and mass spectra were acquired at mass resolving power R = 600 from m\/z 85\u2013500 at 10 spectra\/s and 1800 V detector voltage without turning on the mass defect option. Recording ended after 1200 s. The instrument performed autotuning for mass calibration using FC43 (Perfluorotributylamine) before starting analysis sequences.","Data transformation: Files were preprocessed directly after data acquisition and stored as ChromaTOF-specific *.peg files. ChromaTOF was used for data preprocessing without smoothing, 3 s peak width, baseline subtraction just above the noise level, and automatic mass spectral deconvolution and peak detection at signal\/noise levels of 10:1 throughout the chromatogram.","Metabolite id: The LECO\/Fiehn metabolomics library was used to identify compounds. Each compound was assigned a similarity value, a measurement of the similarity of the collected spectrum with the library mass spectrum, with an assignment cut-off value of 70%. Primary metabolite data analysis was performed using ChromaTOF software, Version 4.43.3.0, which supports automatic deconvolution of all mass spectra from a chromatogram, built in mass-spectral correction for co-eluting metabolites, calculation of retention indices, and identification of a suitable fragment mass-to charge ratio for selective quantification. In the Statistical Compare feature of the ChromaTOF, the processed samples were added to a sample table, and assigned to their respective groups. The compounds were then aligned based on similarities in both retention time and mass spectral match."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS208","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS208","title":"The response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nitrogen deprivation: a systems biology analysis","date":"2015-06-29","timestamp":1435532400,"submitter":["Jeong-Jin Park","David Gang"],"publications":[{"title":"The response of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to nitrogen deprivation: a systems biology analysis.","doi":"10.1111\/tpj.12747","pubmed":"PMID:25515814"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"Pagasus 4D GC-MS (LECO)","organism":"Chlamydomonas reinhardtii","organism_parts":"whole organism","metabolites":["1-Hexadecanol","Glyceryl monostearate","(R)-2-hydroxyglutarate","2-Hydroxyvaleric acid","2-Isopropylmalic acid","4-Methyl-2-oxovaleric acid","2-Palmitoylglycerol","2-Hydroxybutyric acid","3-phosphoglycerate","4-hydroxybenzoic acid","Methylthioadenosine","acetohydroxamic acid","adenosine","adenosine 5'-monophosphate","L-alanine","ketoglutarate","L-arabinose","arginine","ornithine","DL-Asparagine","L-aspartic acid","benzoic acid","Butyl stearate","Decanoic acid","cholesterol","Citramalic acid","DL-Cysteine","D(-)-Fructose","beta-D-Fructose 6-phosphate","fumaric acid","D-Galactopyranose","Galactose-6-phosphate","Galacturonic acid","gamma-Tocopherol","D-Glucopyranose","alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate","L-Sorbose 1P","D-Glucopyranuronic acid","L-glutamic acid","L-glutamine","D-glycerate","glycerol","3-Glycerophosphate","glycerol-beta-phosphate","glycine","glycolate","guanine","heptadecanoic acid","L-histidine","L-homoserine","hydroxylamine","cis-9-eicosenoic acid","inositol 4-phosphate","Inulobiose","isocitric acid","l-isoleucine","isonicotinic acid","L-threonic acid","lactic acid","lauric acid","L-leucine","linoleic acid","linolenic acid","L-lysine","malate","maleic acid","maltose","Methyl dihydrogen phosphate","DL-methionine","1-Palmitoylglycerol","Tetradecanoic acid","Octadecan-1-ol","oleic acid","L-ornithine","oxalic acid","L-Pyroglutamic acid","palmitic acid","palmitoleic acid","3-[[(2R)-2,4-dihydroxy-3,3-dimethylbutanoyl]amino]propanoate","Nonanoic acid","Pentadecanoic acid","L-phenylalanine","2-Aminoethyl dihydrogen phosphate","Phosphoric acid","Phytol","L-proline","putrescine","ribofuranose","Ribose phosphate","salicylic acid","L-serine","stearic acid","succinic acid","sucrose","l-Threitol","L-threonine","alpha-Tocopherol","L-tyrosine","urea","L-valine","xylitol","Alpha-d-xylopyranose"]}},"MTBLS298":{"description":["Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major risk factor leading to chronic liver disease and type 2 diabetes. Here we chart liver metabolic activity and functionality in NAFLD by integrating global transcriptomic data, from human liver biopsies, and metabolic flux data, measured across the human splanchnic vascular bed, within a genome-scale model of human metabolism. We show that an increased amount of liver fat induces mitochondrial metabolism, lipolysis, glyceroneogenesis and a switch from lactate to glycerol as substrate for gluconeogenesis, indicating an intricate balance of exacerbated opposite metabolic processes in glycemic regulation. These changes were associated with reduced metabolic adaptability on a network level in the sense that liver fat accumulation puts increasing demands on the liver to adaptively regulate metabolic responses to maintain basic liver functions. We propose that failure to meet excessive metabolic challenges coupled with reduced metabolic adaptability may lead to a vicious pathogenic cycle leading to the co-morbidities of NAFLD.","Sample collection: The subjects were studied after an overnight fast. Three intravenous cannulas were inserted as described earlier5. Shortly, the first was inserted in an antecubital vein for infusions of saline (first 90 min), glucose, insulin, and potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate, the second was inserted in a contralateral arm and the third catheter was inserted percutaneously under local anaesthesia into a femoral vein. Hepatic blood flow was measured using a constant i.v. infusion of indocyanine green (ICG). Plasma glucose was maintained at 5 mmol\/liter (90 mg\/dl) until 240 min using a variable rate infusion of 20% glucose. Potassium-[2,2-2H2]palmitate bound to human albumin was infused at a rate of 0.05 \u00b5mol\/kg\/min starting at 30 min to trace FFA and TG metabolism in vivo. Hepatic blood flow was measured at 90, 100, 110, 120, 200, 220, 240 min. During the saline and insulin infusion, arterialized and hepatic vein plasma samples were taken at 10-60 min intervals. The fat content of the liver biopsy specimens (% of hepatocytes with macrovesicular steatosis) was determined by an experienced liver pathologist in a blinded fashion. The % of macrovesicular steatosis was used as the liver fat %.","Extraction: Each serum sample (20 \u00b5l) was spiked with internal standard (20 \u00b5l labeled palmitic acid, c=258 mg\/l) and the mixture was then extracted with 400 \u00b5l of methanol. After centrifugation the supernatant was evaporated to dryness and the original metabolites were then converted into their methoxime and trimethylsilyl derivative(s) by two-step derivatization. First, 25 \u00b5l methoxamine reagent was added to the residue and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 45 \u00b0C. Next, 25 \u00b5l N-Methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide was added and the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 45 \u00baC. Finally, retention index standard mixture (n-alkanes) in hexane was added to the mixture.","Chromatography: Leco Pegasus 4D GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS instrument (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI) equipped with a cryogenic modulator was used. The GC part of the instrument was an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA), equipped with split\/splitless injector. The first-dimension chromatographic column was a 10 m RTX-5 capillary column with an internal diameter of 0.18 mm and a stationary-phase film thickness of 0.20 \u00b5m, and the second-dimension chromatographic column was a 1.5 m BPX-50 capillary column with an internal diameter of 100 \u00b5m and a film thickness of 0.1 \u00b5m. A diphenyltetramethyldisilazane deactivated retention gap (3 m x 0.53 mm i.d.) was used in the front of the first column. High-purity helium was used as the carrier gas at a constant pressure mode (39.6 psig). A 5 s separation time was used in the second dimension.","Mass spec: The mass spectra were recorded by electron ionization (EI) at 70 eV in the m\/z range of 45 \u2013 700 amu with 100 spectra\/sec on a Leco Pegasus 4D GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS instrument. Split injection (1 \u00b5l, split ratio 1:20) at 260 \u00b0C was used. The temperature program was as follows: the first-dimension column oven ramp began at 50 \u00b0C with a 1 min hold after which the temperature was programmed to 295 \u00b0C at a rate of 10 \u00b0C\/min and then held at this temperature for 3 min. The second-dimension column temperature was maintained 20 \u00b0C higher than the corresponding first-dimension column. The programming rate and hold times were the same for the two columns.","Data transformation: Data transformationThe original GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS data included retention times, retention indices (RI), spectral information, possible identification, spectral similarity value (S=0-1000) and peak response data. The linear retention indexes were calculated based on the retention times of the compounds and the retention times of the retention index standards (n-alkanes). The data were transferred into an in-house developed program Guineu25. The alignment of the data was done based on the two retention times and spectra. After alignment of the GC\u00d7GC-TOFMS data, two filtration criteria were used for positive identification: 1) spectral match < 850 and 2) the RIexp-RIlit < 25 or RIexp-RIstd_exp < 25, in which RIexp is the experimental RI for a compound and RIlit is the literature value for the identified compound and RIstd_exp is the experimental RI value for a standard compound. Compounds not fulfilling the criteria were renamed to unknowns and were subjected to further identification. Calibration curves (six points, c=15-2000 ng, cholesterol c=170-6000 ng) were constructed for the following compounds: pyruvic acid, alanine, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, valine, leucine, isoleucine, proline, glycine, succinic acid, fumaric acid, serine, threonine, malic acid, methionine, aspartic acid, alpha-ketoglutaric acid, phenylalanine, glutamic acid, ornithine, citric acid, tyrosine, palmitic acid, linoleic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidonic acid, and cholesterol.","Metabolite id: The identification was based on the spectral search from NIST library or the in-house collected library and the retention indices. The compounds for which no spectral match was found by the two libraries, GOLM database (http:\/\/gmd.mpimp-golm.mpg.de) was utilized. The database was also used for functional group prediction of the metabolites."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS298","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS298","title":"Genome-scale study

nutrient levels. Eukaryotic algae such as diatoms are extremely sensitive to phosphorus limitation and recent transcriptomics work has suggested that multiple cellular processes are affected under these growth conditions. Metabolomics is the systematic study of intra- and extracellular metabolites, i.e. the end products of microbial metabolism. As such, metabolomics complements genomics and transcriptomics through the identification and quantification of metabolic intermediates that reflect cellular physiology. Here, we applied intracellular metabolomics to examine the differential response of the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana to phosphate-replete and phosphate-limited growth conditions. We focused on metabolites from the purine and pyrimidine biochemical pathways, due to their role in phosphorus cycling associated with nucleic acid synthesis. Under phosphate-replete conditions, T. pseudonana stored nucleotides with phosphate moieties such as adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP) and, to a lesser extent, inosine 5'-monophosphate (IMP). In contrast, under phosphate-limited conditions, T. pseudonana had higher concentrations of adenine, inosine, and adenosine all of which lack phosphate moieties. Furthermore, based on previously published transcriptomics data, T. pseudonana differentially regulates select genes that can alter these nucleic acid precursors through the gain or loss of the phosphate moiety. Thus, our analysis of the metabolomics and transcriptomics data converged upon the sensitivity of the purine biochemical pathway to phosphorus availability.","Sample collection: Thalassiosira pseudonana (CCMP #1335) was cultured axenically in a modified version of L1 media made with Turks Island Salts in order to reduce the background concentration of dissolved organic carbon in the media. The phosphate-replete treatment contained 36 \u00b5M PO4 and the phosphate-limited treatment had 0.4 \u00b5M PO4. Prior to the experiment, the culture had been maintained through two culture transfers of phosphate-replete or phosphate-limited media. The experiment began with the addition of 30 ml of T. pseudonana in exponential phase to two-thirds of the flasks which contained 300 ml of media. The remaining one-third of the flasks were designated as cell-free controls. Two flasks with cells and one cell-free control for each media (phosphate-replete or phosphate-limited) were sampled at four time points: 0, 2, 8, and 10 days.","Extraction: The intracellular metabolites were extracted using a method modified from a protocol previously described in [1]. Briefly, the filter was extracted three times with ice-cold extraction solvent (acetonitrile:methanol:water with 0.1 M formic acid, 40:40:20). The combined extracts were neutralized with ammonium hydroxide and dried in a vacufuge. The samples for the targeted mass spectrometry analysis were re-dissolved in 95:5 (v\/v) water:acetonitrile and combined with deuterated biotin (final concentration 0.05 \u00b5g\/ml)as an internal standard. For untargeted analysis, the extracts had to undergo an additional de-salting step prior to analysis. Therefore, the dried extracts were re-dissolved in 0.01 M hydrochloric acid and extracted using a 50 mg\/1 cc PPL cartridge following the protocol of [2]. The resulting methanol extracts were re-dissolved in 95:5 water:acetonitrile and deuterated biotin. Ref: [1] Rabinowitz JD, Kimball E.

","Chromatography: For targeted metabolomics analysis, the samples were analyzed with a Synergi 4 \u00b5m Fusion \u2013 RP 80 \u00c5, 150 \u00d7 2.00 mm column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) coupled to a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. The chromatography gradient was: an initial hold of 95% A (0.1% formic acid in water) : 5% B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) for 2 minutes, ramp to 65% B from 2 to 20 minutes, ramp to 100% B from 20 to 25 min, and hold until 32.5 minutes. The column was re-equilibrated for 7 min between samples with solvent A. Each metabolite was quantified using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with optimal parameters determined from infusion of authentic standards. Eight-point external calibration curves (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100, 250, and 500 ng\/ml) were generated for each compound by plotting peak area against concentration. For untargeted metabolomics analysis, LC separation was performed using a Synergi Fusion reversed phase column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) with the same gradient as for targeted analysis.","Mass spec: For targeted analysis, samples were analyzed with a Thermo Scientific TSQ Vantage Triple Stage Quadrupole Mass Spectrometer. This instrument allows polarity switching between positive and negative ion mode within a single LC run. Analysis of authentic standards was used to determine the optimal ionization mode for each metabolite. For untargeted analysis, samples were analyzed in both negative and positive ion mode with liquid chromatography (LC) coupled by electrospray ionization to a 7-Tesla Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS). In parallel to the FT acquisition, four data dependent MS\/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every six samples in order to assess instrument variability.","Data transformation: Targeted metabolomics dataThe resulting data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool [1] and processed with MAVEN [2]. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng\/ml. Note that the concentration of these metabolites in the cell-free controls has been subtracted from the corresponding treatment with Thalassiosira. Untargeted metabolomics dataData were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard [1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS [3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm [4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m\/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition [5] and 2) to extract the intensities and m\/z values for the associated MS\/MS spectra.

Metabolome-wide analysis is challenging as it requires grouping of metabolite features over different samples. We developed DynaMet for fully automated investigations of isotope labeling experiments from LC-high resolution MS raw data. DynaMet enables untargeted extraction of metabolite labeling profiles and provides integrated tools for expressive data visualization. For this study we generated labeling data of the model strain Escherichia coli from 13C glucose labeling switch experiments. Analysis of two biological replicates revealed high robustness and reproducibility of the pipeline.

Of these, 222 and 230, respectively, could be fitted with the implemented model. After removing false positives and merging both data sets DynaMet revealed a total number of 291 features with labeling profiles whereof 285 could be generated with implemented fitting function. Comparison with KEGG database resulted in 125 matches corresponding to 98 metabolites covering multiple pathways of core metabolism and major biosynthetic routes.

To match features to data base, monoisotopic masses of features are calculated from possible adducts mass shifts. In case of successful adduct grouping the assigned monoisotopic mass is used to search for masses in database within user defined maximal deviation whereby matches are further restricted by estimation of metabolites possible number of carbon atoms. We estimated the number of carbon atoms from mass isotopologue pattern of natural labeled, and if provided, from a mixture of natural labeled and uniformly 13C labeled cell extract. As a general restriction the range of the possible number of carbon atoms is calculated for each metabolite, whereby the lower limit is defined by the number of 13C related mass isotopologues grouped per feature and the upper limit by the compound with similar mass present in the Pubchem database containing most number of carbon atoms. Depending on the consistency and reliability of the results obtained by applied estimation methods, each estimation gets a quality score (q-score) ranging from 0 to 15, and best scored estimation is selected. For the current study the KEGG database was used. For each compound in each sample we determined the summed number of labeled Carbon atoms: n_13C=(f_M0 * f_M1*1 + f_Mn *n) where n is number of C atoms, f_Mi is f_Mi=A_Mi\/A_tot and A_Mi is ith isotopologue of metabolite i, A_tot is summed area of all isotopologues, A_tot=summed area of all isotopologue of a feauture where m is the metabolites number of carbon atoms.

Briefly, 20 \u00b5l of a 20mg\/ml methoxyamine hydrochloride in pyridine was added to the dried extracts, vortexed and incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min. After returning the samples to room temperature, 91 \u00b5l of MSTFA + RI standards were added, vortexed and incubated at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min. Samples were then centrifuged at 14,500 rpm for 15 min, and 60 \u00b5l of the supernatant was transferred into 250 \u00b5l clear glass autosampler vials. Ref: [1] Fiehn O, Kind T.

","Chromatography: Untargeted GC-MS: Metabolites extracted from plasma samples were analyzed by using both the GC-qMS (Agilent 5975C MSD coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC) and GC-TOFMS (LECO Pegasus TOF coupled to an Agilent 7890A GC) systems both equipped with an Electron Impact ionization source. For the GC-qMS, Agilent J&W DB-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m film 95% dimethyl\/5% diphenyl polysiloxane) + 10 m Duragard Capillary column was installed and calibrated. Prior to sample analysis, the GC system was locked by performing retention time locking (RTL) of myristic acid d27 at 16.727 min. The samples were injected in splitless mode, with the injection port held at 250 \u00b0C. The initial oven temperature was held at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and then ramped at 10 \u00b0C\/min to 325 \u00b0C and held for 10 min. The post run is 1 min to allow the oven cool down to 60 \u00b0C. For the GC-TOFMS system, Agilent HP-5 column (30 m x 0.32 mm id x 0.25 \u00b5m film 95% dimethyl\/5% diphenyl polysiloxane) was used. 99.9% pure Helium was set at a constant flow of 1.5 ml\/min. The oven temperature was held constant at 70 \u00b0C for 4 min and then ramped at 20 \u00b0C\/min to 300 \u00b0C at which it was held constant for 5 min. Targeted GC-SIM-MS: Targeted quantification was performed in SIM mode by using the GC-qMS platform. The methods for sample preparation, GC separation, injection, and RI calibration were the same as the untargeted metabolomic analysis by GC-qMS described in previous sections.","Mass spec: Untargeted GC-MS: For GC-qMS data acquired on the Agilent 5975C MSD, the MSD transfer line was held at 290 \u00b0C, ion source at 250 \u00b0C and the mass analyzer at 150 \u00b0C. The data were acquired in 37.5 min with 5.9 min solvent delay at normal scan rate in the mass range 50\u2013600D amu. For the GC-TOFMS data on the LECO Pegasus TOF, the transfer line temperature between the GC and the MS was set to 225 \u00b0C. The ion source temperature was set at 200 \u00b0C. After 5 min of solvent delay, filament was turned on and mass spectra were acquired over the range of m\/z of 50\u2013600D amu at an acquisition rate of 20 scans\/s. The detector was operated in the range of 1400\u20131600 V with an optimized voltage offset of 200 V. Recording ended after 19.5 min. Targeted GC-SIM-MS: Targeted quantification was performed in SIM mode by using the GC-qMS platform. The methods for sample preparation, GC separation, injection, and RI calibration were the same as the untargeted metabolomic analysis by GC-qMS described in previous sections. The targets for this analysis included analytes that displayed statistically significant differences between cases and controls in our untargeted analysis and other related studies. For each analyte, four ions were selected based on their specificity and intensity, with one used as a quantifier for intensity calculation and others used as qualifiers for confirmation. The fragments were selected based on the uniqueness across co-eluting analytes and their relative intensity compared to the base peak in the spectrum. Time segments are set up to allow at least 10 ms dwell time for each ion monitored.","Data transformation: Untargeted GC-MS: For GC-qMS, .D Agilent files were converted to netCDF format using ChemStation software. For GC-TOFMS, peg LECO files were converted to netCDF format using ChromaTOF software. Targeted GC-SIM-MS: For GC-SIM-MS, .D Agilent files were converted to netCDF format using ChemStation software.","Metabolite id: Untargeted GC-MS: The GC-TOFMS data were analyzed using the LECO ChromaTOF software. The GC-qMS data were processed by the Automated Mass Spectral Deconvolution and Identification System (AMDIS) [1] for peak detection, deconvolution, and metabolite identification. The results were then imported into Mass Profiler Professional (MPP) for alignment and statistical analysis. In addition, both the GC-TOFMS and GC-qMS data were analyzed by MetaboliteDetector [2], which allows the utilization of RI values for alignment using the RI values calculated for every detected analyte based on RI calibration that were performed for each batch separately. The calculated RI values were also used for narrowing the library search results, thereby reducing the number of false putative identifications. Also, MetaboliteDetector enables us to select the top three fragments based on the quality of their EICs. Putative metabolite identifications were determined based on spectral matching using the Fiehn and NIST libraries. The Fiehn library includes spectra only from TMS compounds. To reduce the false discovery rate in the metabolite identification process using the NIST library, we extracted all compounds acquired by TMS derivatization (around 5,000 compounds with more than 22,000 spectra). Prior to statistical analysis, raw intensities were log-transformed to make the component intensity distributions more comparable with a normal probability density function. Based on the number of measurements available for each feature across the runs, we used three different steps to evaluate the statistical significance comparing cases and controls. If a peak is found in most of the runs from one group and is missing completely in the other group, it is considered as a potential candidate without any further statistical hypothesis testing. If a peak is present in both groups, but missing in many runs, a logistic regression model is used to find the difference between cases and controls and significance is estimated based on the calculated p-values. The remaining peaks were analyzed by using a two-way ANOVA model. To control the false discovery rate (FDR), we calculated q-values using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Analytes were selected based on two criteria (consistent mean fold change direction in all batches and q<0.1), i.e., analytes with significant group effect but insignificant batch-group interaction were selected. The mean fold change was calculated for each batch separately based on the cases and controls within the batch. Also the batch-group interaction term was included to avoid overestimation of the error variance as it can increase the number of false negatives. Targeted GC-SIM-MS: We used MetaboliteDetector to find the retention time (RT) values for a subset of the targets with relatively high similarity scores. These RT values were compared against those in the Fiehn library to estimate the difference between expected and observed elution times. Following that, we used an in-house tool to extract the EIC guided by the estimated RT from the previous step. The algorithm uses an RT window centered at the expected elution time of the analyte of interest and searches the neighborhood area for all detected peaks at monitored masses. The quantifier fragment is used to perform the search and all qualifiers peaks are found based on the location of the quantifier peak. Following smoothing of the EICs and baseline correction, the peak width and the area under the curve (AUC) of the EICs are calculated. Finally, a similarity score is calculated based on the expected SIM spectra from the library to verify the identification. Since only four fragments were monitored per analyte in the SIM mode, we used a more restrictive approach to calculate the spectral matching similarity score [3]. Specifically, a mixed measure is used based on two scores: (i) weighted dot product; (ii) average pairwise ratios between fragments. Also, we checked each EIC by visual inspection to avoid identification errors. Ref: [1] Stein SE.

Here we explore tissue-level metabolic specialization in Nicotiana attenuata, an ecological model with rich secondary metabolism by combining tissue-wide non-targeted mass spectral data acquisition, information theory analysis, and MS\/MS molecular networks. This analysis was conducted for two different methanolic extracts of 14 tissues and deconvoluted 895 non-redundant MS\/MS spectra. Using information theory analysis, anthers were found to harbor the most specialized metabolome and, through MS\/MS molecular networks, most unique metabolites of anthers and other tissues were annotated. Finally, tissue-metabolite association maps were used to predict tissue-specific gene functions. Predictions for the function of two UDP-glycosyltransferases in flavonoid metabolism were confirmed by virus-induced gene-silencing. The present workflow allows biologists to amortize the vast amount of data produced by modern MS instrumentation for their quest to understand gene function.","Sample collection: We extracted 14 different tissues from 28 and 50-day-old Nicotiana. attenuata plants growing in the glasshouse. Non-reproductive tissue sample collection included: a pool of all non-senescing rosette leaves, combined lower, middle and higher segments of the stem, the complete root system and matured seeds. Reproductive parts were harvested as follows; complete floral buds of 8 mm length \u2013 a stage at which the corolla has not yet protruded from the sepals \u2013 were harvested. Mature flowers at anthesis (5 days post-8mm stage, 7pm), were carefully separated into the following parts: the pedicel, complete sepal ring, the nectary, the ovary (not including the nectary), the style, anthers, filaments (not including anthers), the corolla tube (not including the limb) and the corolla limb.","Extraction: Pools of 100 mg of isolated tissues were extracted as follows using extraction buffers containing either 20% or 80% of methanol to increase the coverage of chemically-diverse metabolite classes. 1 ml extraction buffer (50 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.8, containing 20% or 80% methanol) per 100 mg tissue was added and samples were homogenized in a ball mill (Genogrinder 2000; SPEX CertiPrep) for 45 s at 1\u00d7 rate and 250 strokes per min. Homogenized samples were centrifuged at 16,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 30 min, and supernatants were transferred into 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tubes and re-centrifuged as before. Supernatants of 400 \u03bcl were transferred to 2 ml glass vials for mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. In order to prevent the discarding of tissue-specific metabolites from the XCMS analysis due to poor grouping across samples, 5 mixed extracts containing all 14 tissues at different ratios were generated and processed simultaneously with all other tissue samples.","Chromatography: 2 \u00b5l of the 20% or 80% methanol leaf extracts were separated by U-HPLC performed on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UHPLC (Dionex, Sunnyvale, USA) system with an Acclaim (Thermo Scientific) column, particle size 2.2 \u00b5m, 2.1 x 150 mm and a 4 mm x 4 mm guard columnof the same material[1].

","Mass spec: Eluted compounds were detected by a high-resolution MicroToF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) equipped with an electrospray ionization source operating in positive ionization mode. Typical instrument settings were as follows: capillary voltage 4500 V, capillary exit 130 V, dry gas temperature 200 \u00b0C, dry gas flow of 8 l\/min. Ions were detected from m\/z 50 to 1400 at a repetition rate of 1 Hz. Mass calibration was performed using sodium formate clusters (10 mM solution of NaOH in 50\/50% v\/v isopropanol\/water containing 0.2% formic acid). idMS\/MS datasets were acquired by operating the instrument with an isolation mass 400 Da, an isolation width 300 Da (largest width meaning all mass is accessible) and collision energies set either to 20, 30, 40, 50ev to cover broad range mass signal fragmentation by collision-induced dissociation (CID). idMS\/MS data collection was restricted to ten samples that were initially selected based on the high range of chemical variations within the total sample population that these samples captured. Four microliters of each of these samples were first analyzed by UHPLC-ESI\/qTOF-MS in profile mode (single MS approach, collision energy of 0 ev) using the aforementioned chromatographic conditions with the objective of identifying compound precursors later on associated with molecular fragments as well as of inferring fragmentation patterns due to in-source collision during ionization (low cone voltage settings). The same samples were then analyzed for idMS\/MS data acquisition at 4 different collision energy conditions (20, 30, 40 and 50ev) separately with all detectable mass signals being equally considered as dissociation targets.","Data transformation: Raw data files were converted to netCDF format using the export function of the Data Analysis v4.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).","Metabolite id: This MS profile dataset (MS1) and 4 CID-derived MS\/MS datasets were rapidly aligned and post-processed using open source programs.

In this set of algorithms, large capacities of LCMS data can be analyzed by realigning the m\/z based on certain parameters. The output of apLCMS includes retention times, m\/z features that appeared in the LCMS run, and also the ion intensities of each of these m\/z features for every sample. The data will be used for further data analysis. Files were converted to .cdf using Thermo File Converter and then to apLCMS. Quality Assurance: 1. Five standards were chosen and graphed out to view the intensity over the entire set run. The standards provide information and assurance that the plasma samples were acceptable for further analysis. 2. Total Ion intensity was used as a good indicator on whether the batch was interrupted midway or not.

Using high-resolution liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), we performed nontargeted, quantitative metabolomics analysis in blood of 15 young (29 \u00b1 4 y of age) and 15 elderly (81 \u00b1 7 y of age) individuals. Coefficients of variation (CV = SD\/mean) were obtained for 126 blood metabolites of all 30 donors. Fifty-five RBC-enriched metabolites, for which metabolomics studies have been scarce, are highlighted here. We found 14 blood compounds that show remarkable age-related increases or decreases; they include 1,5-anhydroglucitol, dimethyl-guanosine, acetyl-carnosine, carnosine, ophthalmic acid, UDP-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetyl-arginine, N6-acetyl-lysine, pantothenate, citrulline, leucine, isoleucine, NAD+, and NADP+. Six of them are RBC-enriched, suggesting that RBC metabolomics is highly valuable for human aging research. Age differences are partly explained by a decrease in antioxidant production or increasing inefficiency of urea metabolism among the elderly. Pearson\u2019s coefficients demonstrated that some age-related compounds are correlated, suggesting that aging affects them concomitantly. Although our CV values are mostly consistent with those CVs previously published, we here report previously unidentified CVs of 51 blood compounds. Compounds having moderate to high CV values (0.4\u20132.5) are often modified. Compounds having low CV values, such as ATP and glutathione, may be related to various diseases because their concentrations are strictly controlled, and changes in them would compromise health. Thus, human blood is a rich source of information about individual metabolic differences. <\/p> Validation of experimental procedures was performed as follows. First, we evaluated the contribution of sample handling to within-sample variation. The same blood sample preparation was injected 3x into the LC-MS at 80-min intervals. We thus obtained within-sample CVs (designated as CVwi), which were less than 0.1 in 107 of 126 compounds (85%). Only 10 compounds showed CVwi of 0.1-0.2, while 9 had CVwi >0.2. Second, we also examined sample-to-sample variation caused by sample preparation. Three samples were independently prepared from the same blood sample (one person), and CVs thus determined were designated as CVss. CVss values of HEPES and PIPES in the blood samples were very small (0.06~0.08 for HEPES and 0.04~0.08 for PIPES). The great majority (116\/126=92%) of CVss were <0.3. <\/p> Blood samples drawn from four volunteers four times within 24 h are available under accession number MTBLS264. Whole blood metabolomic data from all 30 subjects are available under accession number MTBLS265.

After brief vortexing, samples were transferred to Amicon Ultra 10-kDa cut-off filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) to remove proteins and cell debris. Following sample concentration by vacuum evaporation, each sample was resuspended in 40 \u03bcl of 50% acetonitrile and 1 \u03bcl (equivalent to 5 \u03bcl of initial sample) was used for each injection into the LC-MS system.","Chromatography: LC-MS data were obtained using a Paradigm MS4 HPLC system (Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA, USA) coupled to an LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), as described previously[1].

Furthermore, shRNA mediated reduction of Aqp9 expression reduces liver triacylglycerol (TAG) accumulation in a diet induced rat model of obesity. The aim of this study was to investigate metabolic effects of Aqp9 deletion in coisogenic db\/db mice of the C57BL\/6 background. Aqp9wt db\/db and Aqp9-\/- db\/db mice did not differ in body weight and liver TAG contents. On the C57BL\/6 genetic background we observed elevated plasma glucose in Aqp9-\/- db\/db mice (+ 1.1 mM, life-time average) while plasma insulin concentration was reduced at time of death. Glucose levels changed similarly in pentobarbital anesthetized, glucagon challenged Aqp9wt db\/db and Aqp9-\/- db\/db mice. Liver transcriptional profiling did not detect differential gene expression between genotypes. Metabolite profiling revealed a sex independent increase in plasma glycerol (+55%), glucose (+24%) and reduction in threonate (all at q<0.1) in Aqp9-\/- db\/db mice compared to controls. Metabolite profiling thus confirms a role of AQP9 in glycerol metabolism of obese C57BL\/6 db\/db mice.

With this rationale, there is a continuous aim to define the distribution of these compounds in plants, to better understand their metabolism and to increase their concentration levels in fruits and vegetables. This study aimed at deepening the knowledge on the regulatory role of phytohormones in carotenoid metabolism. More specifically, it was envisaged to reveal the phytohormones involved in the metabolism of alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lycopene, lutein and zeaxanthin. To this purpose, the phytohormone profiles of 50 tomato fruits were determined by high-resolution Orbitrap mass spectrometry and evaluated towards the associated carotenoid levels. Data mining was performed by differential expression and orthogonal partial least squares analyses. This metabolomics approach revealed 5 phytohormonal metabolites, which significantly influenced (Variable Importance in Projection scores =0.80) carotenoid metabolism. These metabolites were identified as cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid, cucurbic acid, 2-oxindole-3-acetic acid, 1-acetylindole-3-carboxaldehyde, and cis-zeatin-O-glucoside. The involvement of the individual phytohormones towards carotenoid metabolism was investigated by regression analysis (P values =0.05, R2 varying between 0.280 and 0.760) and statistical correlation (P values =0.01, correlation varying between 0.403 and 0.846). It was concluded that these phytohormones all have significant contributing value in the regulation of carotenoid metabolism, thereby exhibiting down- and up-regulating influences. As a result, this knowledge encloses the potential for improving tomato fruit nutritional quality by targeted control of agronomic conditions, exogenous use of plant bioregulators, or genetic engineering.","Sample collection: Tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum L. cv. Moneymaker) were grown in a greenhouse compartment of the Institute for Agricultural and Fisheries Research (ILVO, Melle, Belgium) and were subjected to normal cultural practices [1]. When tomato plants were 29 weeks old, 108 tomato fruits were collected from 4 tomato plants during a single harvest moment. Considering the days after anthesis (DAA), the harvested tomato fruits were classified into five groups (see Table S1 in the paper associated with this study), representing various developmental stages. Next, from each group, 10 fruits were selected for analysis. As such, different stages of fruit development and ripening were enclosed, whereby a wide range of carotenoid concentrations and divergent phytohormone profiles were covered. Selection of these fruits was each time realized in such a way that the number of different plants and trusses, from which the fruits originated, was maximized. For each single batch of 10 fruits, at least three different plants and thus at least three different trusses were considered. The consecutive cutting, lyophilization, grinding and sieving of each individual tomato fruit resulted in a homogenous powder, which allowed representative sampling. It should be noted that from the moment that the tomato fruits were harvested, they were kept cold (-20 \u00b0C) and shielded from light in order to prevent degradation of any fruit component.

Ionization source working parameters are: Auxiliary gas pressure 5 au; Sweep gas pressure 2 au; Heater temperature 330 \u00b0C; Capillary temperature 220 \u00b0C; Capillary voltage 65 (-62.5) V; Tube lens voltage 75 (-100) V; Skimmer voltage 24 (-27) V. An m\/z scan range of 100 - 800 was selected and the resolution was set at 100,000 full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 1 Hz (1 scan per second). The automatic gain control (AGC) target was set at the high dynamic range (3 x 10^6 ions). Instrument control and data processing were carried out by Xcalibur 2.1 software. Because of the applied full-scan operating principle of this type of mass spectrometer and the associated metabolomic screening possibilities, the phytohormone profiles of the individual tomato fruits could be defined by means of chemometric data analysis. To ensure data quality for metabolomic screening purposes, system stability during analysis was verified by using matrix-matched calibration curves [1]. These curves (6 calibration levels) were set up in early-stage tomato fruit matrix and were run at the beginning and end of the batch of samples. For each of the major hormonal classes, at least one representative was considered. The following average coefficients of variance (n = 6) were obtained: 6.25% for abscisic acid, 5.07% for N6-benzyladenine, 6.93% for epibrassinolide, 6.26% for gibberellic acid, 5.97% for jasmonic acid, 9.26% for salicylic acid, 0.77% for zeatin, and 7.43% for indol-3-acetic acid. Since these values were well below 15% [2], appropriate stability during analysis was concluded. Ref: [1] Van Meulebroek, L., Vanden Bussche, J., Steppe, K., and Vanhaecke, L. (2012).

We used the XCMS package to preprocess each of the three UPLC-QTOF MS datasets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. The peak matching algorithm in XCMS takes into account the two-dimensional anisotropic nature of data. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that originated from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation.","Metabolite id: For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts were used on the basis of parametric and non-parametric statistical tests (t-test and the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). In both statistical tests, we calculated the false discovery rate (FDR) to correct for multiple testing. To select ions with significant and consistent changes between HCC and cirrhotic patients in multiple experiments, we used an ion-annotation-assisted approach. This approach is designed to determine overlapping ions among multiple experiments by taking into consideration the presence of a large number of derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and fragments. This is accomplished by grouping ions into clusters, where each ion in a cluster is represented by its monoisotopic mass. This mass is then used to compare the ions across the three experiments. The common ions obtained based on monoisotopic masses using the ion annotation information are merged with those selected on the basis of their ion masses only. Putative identifications for the resulting ion list were obtained through mass-based search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. Ingenuity Pathways Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA) and MetaboAnalyst (http:\/\/www.metaboanalyst.ca\/) were used to perform enrichment analysis on a list of putative identifications of altered metabolites to identify a biological pathway that can be further investigated. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS\/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds.

The samples were transferred to pre-cooled Eppendorf vials (2 ml). The Eppendorf vials were centrifuged at -10 \u00b0C for 1 min at 1000 x g (fixed rotor). The supernatant was removed to avoid any remaining growth medium to be trapped in the cell pellet. The cell pellet was reconstituted in 50 \u00b5l of 60% MeOH in ddH2O (-40 \u00b0C) and slightly shaken. Then, 2 \u00b5l of the cell suspension (2,500,000 cells\/ml) was spread over a cooled MAMS plate (-4 \u00b0C). The distribution of the number of cells per well is stochastic (i.e. Poisson distribution). After the cells were distributed on the MAMS chip, the rest of the reconstituted yeast sample was once more centrifuged and shock frozen for population-level (bulk sample) control measurements at a later time point. To avoid any changes to the metabolism during the cell counting step, the MAMS plate was cooled using liquid nitrogen in a nitrogen-rich atmosphere (with a constant flow of N2 gas) to avoid condensation of moisture from air on the surfaces of the MAMS chip and the microscope optics. To avoid any cross-contamination between empty- and cell-containing-wells in the MAMS, the chip was placed in a dry-freezing cham ber for 15 min, after counting the cells. This step allowed us to remove residual moisture that remains on the surface of the MAMS chip prior the matrix deposi tion step. Most of the metabolites that were detected in this publication, using the MAMS platform, are the most abundant metabolites found within S. cerevisiae cells. Cell handling: The cell handling protocol was adapted from [1]. In brief the workflow consisted on the following: 1 ml from the main culture of yeast cells (YSBN.6) was quenched in 4 ml of a MeOH\/ddH2O mixture (60:40) + 0.85% (w\/V) ammonium bicarbonate buffer, and pre-cooled at -40 \u00b0C. Three types of aliquots were prepared from the main culture of yeast cells: Reference samples were untreated aliquots; Control samples were aliquots treated with 500 \u00b5l of HPLC-MS grade water (ddH2O) at 4 \u00b0C; and Treated samples were aliquots treated with 500 \u00b5l of a 2% (mg\/ml) solution of 2-deoxy-d-glucose (HPLC-MS grade water). The falcon tubes containing the different aliquots were immediately submerged in a -40 \u00b0C glycerol bath for 1 min to ensure quenching of the metabolism. The samples were then centrifuged for 1 min at -10 \u00b0C at 1000 x g in a non-fixed rotor centrifuge. The supernatant (growth medium) was removed, and the falcon tube containing the cell pellet was then shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C until the measurement.

This instrument is equipped with a 355-nm solid-state laser. Measurements were conducted in the negative-ion reflectron mode, analyzing a mass range between 70 and 1100 m\/z, and using 100 shots (10 subspectra x 10 shots) with center biased rastering. In our measurements, we heavily rely on the accuracy of the mass measurements for confidence on the metabolite identity. In order to exclude any possible mass shifts that may be caused by slightly tilted surfaces or in homogeneity of the conductivity of the MAMS coating and therefore irregular electric fields, we introduced evenly spaced calibration spots surrounding the 100 \u00b5m array. Prior to each MS measurement, the MS instrument was calibrated using 13 metabolite standards evenly distributed in the mass range of interest. MS\/MS analyses were conducted using the collision-induced dissociation (CID) cell in the ABI4800 instrument and air as the collision gas. Unfortunately, tandem mass spectrometry on the same cell sample is not possible in our case, due to limited amount of material present within one microwell. Therefore, we normally carried out tandem MS measurements on different wells to the one in which the parent ions were originally measured. Some times, it was necessary to combine the MS\/MS measurements of a whole MAMS chip to obtain a suitable tandem MS spectrum. Therefore, it was critically also for our purposes to align the MAMS plate (i.e. the microwells) with the laser ionization spots using optical marks.

The chemical assignments were verified by comparing the respective tandem MS\/MS spectra to the ones obtained from commercially available standards, and by using 13C-labeled cells, which were obtained by growing the yeast cells in 13C-labeled glucose. In order to exclude data with faulty assignments, the masses of at least 24 metabolites must be present in the spectrum with a mass deviation lower than 20 ppm (ideally lower than 15 ppm). Phosphoglyceric acid and Acetyl-Coenzyme A were not considered for further data analysis due to their constant mass deviation of 20 ppm or higher. Any spectra that did not contain all 24 metabolites signals within this mass error were discarded. If the ABI4800 software package was unable to recognize a precise peak (even if the S\/N ratio was higher than 3), the peak resolution was calculated manually, and the mass intensity as well as its mass-to-charge ratio were calculated from ASCII files using a MATLAB peak recognition software (version 7.6.0.324 (R2010a), MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). The ASCII files were generated using macros written within the ABI Data Explorer Software. All data from the ABI software packages were then exported to Microsoft Excel(TM). In Excel, the signal intensities for each metabolite in one MAMS microwell, were divided by a known 9-amino acridine unsaturated background signal ([C4H2O4 - H]-, m\/z 112.98933) and the number of cells counted within that well, providing us with the relative signal intensity for each metabolite at the single-cell level. This simple procedure allowed us to compensate for any inconsistencies in the matrix deposition, shot-to-shot and spot-to-spot variation, as well as in differences in the number of trapped cells (biomass) between MAMS microwells. However, to avoid other unexpected sources of variation (e.g. signal suppression, inefficient metabolite extraction, etc) between MAMS substrates, we used the signal of one of the measured metabolite as internal standard. In our case, we selected glutamate (C5H9NO4 - H]-, m\/z 146.04588) as an internal standard, since its relative signal intensity for a whole MAMS plate remains constant, within the time frame of our study and for the different measured sample treatment if the cells originated from the same colony innoculation. Therefore, all metabolite signals obtained from one MAMS chip were adjusted by one single factor, if the average glutamate signal in the whole MAMS plate had a deviation of 10% or more from the expected value.

It is associated with insulin resistance, obesity, glucose intolerance and drug toxicity. Additionally, polymorphisms in, e.g. APOC3, PNPLA3, NCAN and PPP1R3B, correlate with NAFLD. Several studies have already investigated later stages of the disease. This study characterizes and stratifies distinct grades of the early steatosis stages of the disease with the aim of identifying mechanisms underlying the etiology of the disease. We analyzed liver biopsies and serum samples from patients with distinct grades of steatosis (also pre-disease states) employing transcriptomics, serum biomarkers, metabolomics, and proteomics. We unveiled distinct transcriptome, proteome and metabolome profiles in patients with high-grade and low-grade steatosis. In line with previously reported causes of steatosis and insulin resistance our observed expression differences in the levels of cytokines, in the IGF-axis, in fat metabolism and branched chain amino acids provide a comprehensive image of the deregulated biological system underlying the disease.","Sample collection: Serum samples were collected from 18 patients with morbid obesity who admitted into hospital for treatment by bariatric surgery (gastric banding, gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy).

Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Full scan spectra from m\/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m\/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at m\/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) and detected in the ion trap analyzer. The 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energy was 50 in both positive and negative ion mode.4000QTRAP:The 4000 QTRAP (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada) was controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.1 software and operated in Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) mode, using an enhanced MS (EMS) scan from m\/z 400 to 1,050 and 400 to 1,000 in positive and negative ion mode, respectively, at 1,000 Da\/s as a survey scan. Prior to analysis, source parameters were optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80 % mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 36:1 (m\/z 788.6-184) for positive ion mode and PE 36:2 (m\/z 742-279) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 15 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 450 \u00b0C; gas 1 50 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 60 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Source parameters for negative ion mode were: Curtain gas 10 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 4,500 V; temperature 600 \u00b0C; gas 1 20 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 95 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Isolation width was unit resolution, which corresponds to 0.6-0.8 Da. From each survey scan, the four most abundant ions exceeding 1,000 counts were chosen for enhanced product ion (EPI) scans at 4,000 Da\/s. Previously detected target ions were excluded for 10 s.","Data transformation: Data was transformed by msconvert to mzXML, and by LDA in chrom format.","Metabolite id: MS1 peaks were identified as described in an earlier paper [1] and MS\/MS spectra were interpreted by decision rule sets as described in the referenced paper of this study. For the metabolites assignment, a pipe \"|\" was used to discriminate between the individual MS runs, while comma \",\" was used to account for several identifications (e.g. several retention times) and ambiguous identifications (e.g. DG 20:0\/18:0\/-,20:0\/-\/18:0 corresponds to a diacylglyceride where 20:0 is identified to be on the sn-1 position, while 18:0 might be at sn-2 or sn-3).

Flow rate was 250 \u00b5l\/min and 2 \u00b5l of the sample were injected.","Mass spec: Orbitrap Velos Pro CID and HCD: The Orbitrap Velos Pro hybrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was operated in Data Dependent Acquisition (DDA) mode using a HESI II (heated electrospray ionization) ion source. Prior to experiments, lens settings and source parameters were optimized to the signal of PE 34:1 (using protonated\/deprotonated molecular ion in positive\/negative ion mode, respectively) infused into the column effluent of 80% mobile phase B with a mixing tee. Ion source parameters for positive polarity were as follows: Source Voltage 4.5 kV; source temperature 375 \u00b0C; sheath gas 25 arbitrary units (AU); aux gas 9 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Ion source parameters for negative ion mode were: Source voltage 3.8 kV; source temperature 325 \u00b0C; sheath gas 30 AU; aux gas 10 AU; sweep gas 0 AU; capillary temperature 300 \u00b0C. Full scan spectra from m\/z 400 to 1,000 for positive ion mode and from m\/z 400 to 1,000 in negative ion mode were acquired at a target resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at m\/z 400). From each full scan spectrum, ions were selected for sequential fragmentation either in the linear ion trap (collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments) or in the C-trap (higher-energy collision dissociation (HCD) experiments) and detected in the ion trap or the Orbitrap analyzer, respectively. For CID experiments, the 10 most abundant ions of the full scan spectrum were fragmented using He as collision gas (isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation Q 0.2; activation time 10 ms). Normalized collision energy was 50 in both positive and negative ion mode. For HCD experiments, fragment spectra of the 4 most abundant ions were collected in the Orbitrap mass analyzer at a target resolution of 7,500 (FWHM at m\/z 400, isolation width 1.5 m\/z; activation time 0.1 ms). Exclusion time (duration after fragmentation for excluding ions with similar m\/z) was set to 10 s. Normalized collision energy settings were 25 and 50 for positive and negative ion mode, respectively. SYNAPT G1 HDMS QTOF: The SYNAPT G1 HDMS QTOF mass spectrometer (Waters, Manchester, UK) equipped with an ESI (electrospray ionization) source was used for detection. Source parameters were as follows: Capillary temperature 100 \u00b0C; desolvation temperature 400 \u00b0C; nebulizer gas nitrogen. Capillary voltage was 2.6 kV in positive and 2.1 kV in negative ionization mode. Lock spray was achieved by an external pump (L 6200, Hitachi) at a flow rate of 200 \u00b5l\/min with a 1:13 split. Leucine-enkephalin ([M-H]+: m\/z 556.2771 and [M-H]-: m\/z 554.2615) was used as lock mass and measured every 20 s with a scan time of 0.7 s independent of the other scan modes, allowing for continuous mass correction. This error was always below 5 ppm. For MS experiments, the Survey Scan Mode was used with the following settings: MS mass range V mode; extended dynamic range 200 to 1,000 m\/z and 100 to 1,500 m\/z for positive and negative ion mode, respectively; scan time 0.5 s; MS\/MS mass range 50 to 1,500 m\/z; MS\/MS threshold 20 counts\/s, up to 8 ions selected for MS\/MS; MS\/MS scan time, 0.5 s. An inclusion list containing m\/z values of the ions of interest was used for MS\/MS experiments. Collision energy was 30 V in positive and negative ion mode. 4000 QTRAP: The 4000 QTRAP (AB Sciex, Concord, Canada) was controlled by Analyst v. 1.6.1 software and operated in Information Dependent Acquisition (IDA) mode, using an enhanced MS (EMS) scan from m\/z 400 to 1,050 and 400 to 1,000 in positive and negative ion mode, respectively, at 1,000 Da\/s as a survey scan. Prior to analysis, source parameters were optimized using flow injection analysis into an isocratic flow of 80% mobile phase B. Analytes were PC 36:1 (m\/z 788.6-184) for positive ion mode and PE 36:2 (m\/z 742-279) for negative ion mode. The optimized source parameters of the Turbo V ion source for positive ion mode were as follows: Curtain gas 15 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 5,000 V; temperature 450 \u00b0C; gas 1 50 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 60 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. Source parameters for negative ion mode were: Curtain gas 10 AU; collision gas high; ionspray voltage 4,500 V; temperature 600 \u00b0C; gas 1 20 AU; gas 2 50 AU; declustering potential 95 V; collision energy spread 0; collision energy 45 V. From each survey scan, the four most abundant ions exceeding 1,000 counts were chosen for enhanced product ion (EPI) scans at 4,000 Da\/s. Previously detected target ions were excluded for 10 s.","Data transformation: Data was transformed by msconvert to mzXML, and by LDA in chrom format.","Metabolite id: MS1 peaks were identified as described in an earlier paper [1] and MS\/MS spectra were interpreted by decision rule sets as described in the referenced paper of this study. For the metabolites assignment, a pipe \"|\" was used to discriminate between the individual MS runs, while comma \",\" was used to account for several identifications (e.g. several retention times) and ambiguous identifications (e.g. DG 20:0\/18:0\/-,20:0\/-\/18:0 corresponds to a diacylglyceride where 20:0 is identified to be on the sn-1 position, while 18:0 might be at sn-2 or sn-3).

Individuals were reinvestigated at the ages of 60, 70, 77, 82 and 88 years. Information collected includes a medical questionnaire, blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, glucose tolerance test and 24-hr ambulatory blood pressure. At age 70, EDTA-plasma, citrate-plasma, serum and whole blood for DNA extraction were collected from fasting participants and stored at -70\u00b0 C in liquid nitrogen until analysis. Additional EDTA-plasma was collected during oral glucose tolerance test. EDTA-plasma samples were used for the metabolomic profiling. Plasma samples were available for 1,138 participants at 70 years of age (1991-1994). We excluded 110 participants that experienced a CHD event before baseline, resulting in 1,028 individuals included in the current study.

PMID:9484991 ","Extraction: Plasma samples were thawed and 100 \u00b5l of plasma was transferred to 400 \u00b5l methanol in 96-well format to precipitate proteins. This 80% methanol solution was stored at -20 \u00baC overnight, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 3800 x g in 4 \u00baC to pellet precipitated protein. The supernatant was aliquoted to 3 separate 96-well plates, sealed using a heat-seal foil, and stored at -20 \u00baC until analysis. Plate analysis order was completely randomized for each set of injections, and plates were run in batches of 2 plates, reflecting the autosampler capacity. Within each set of 2 plates, the run order was again completely randomized to prevent injection order artifacts. Duplicate injections were performed for all samples, with the second set of injections performed upon completion of the first set of injections for all samples.","Chromatography: One \u00b5l injections of protein-precipitated plasma were performed on a Waters Acquity UPLC system. Separation was performed using a Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C8 column (1.8 \u00b5m, 1.0 x 100 mm), using a gradient from solvent A (95% water, 5% methanol, 0.1% formic acid) to solvent B (95% methanol, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid). Injections were made in 100% A, which was held for 0.1 min, ramped to 40% B in 0.9 min, to 70% B over 2 min, and to 100% B over 8 min. The mobile phase was held at 100% B for 6 min, returned to starting conditions over 0.1 min, and allowed to re-equilibrate at for 5.9 min. Flow rate was constant at 140 \u00b5l\/min for the duration of the run. The column was held at 50 \u00baC, while samples were held at 10 \u00baC.","Mass spec: Column eluent was infused into a Waters Xevo G2 QTOF MS fitted with an electrospray source. Data was collected in positive ion mode, scanning from 50-1200 at a rate of 5 scans per second. Scans were collected alternatively in MS mode at collision energy of 6 V and in idMS\/MS mode using higher collision energy (15-30 V). IdMS\/MS (also called MSE or MSn) allows for unbiased view of MS\/MS fragmentation without additional experiments. Calibration was performed prior to sample analysis via infusion of sodium formate solution, with mass accuracy within 1 ppm. The capillary voltage was held at 2200 V, the source temp at 150 \u00baC, and the desolvation temperature at 350 \u00baC at a nitrogen desolvation gas flow rate of 800 l\/hr. The quadrupole was held at collision energy of 6 V.","Data transformation: Raw data files were converted to .cdf format using Waters DataBridge software for processing.","Metabolite id: Raw data were processed using XCMS software [1]. Procedures to perform non-targeted metabolomics in large-population studies have been previously described by our group [2]; the code has been made publically available at https:\/\/github.com\/andgan\/metabolomics_pipeline. Metabolic feature detection, alignment, grouping, imputation and normalization were performed separately for each study. Each feature is characterized by a specific mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) and retention time. A single metabolite is normally represented by more than one feature. Indiscriminant (id) MS and idMS\/MS spectra were generated for all the significant features [3]. Those with highly similar spectra, strong correlation and similar retention time were deemed to be from the same metabolite. We used the spectra to identify the corresponding metabolite. Four approaches were considered, in agreement with what has been suggested by the Metabolomics Standard Initiative [4]. Normalization: First, feature intensities were transformed to the log2 base scale to approximate normal distribution. Second, potential sample outliers were identified by plotting the total intensity for each sample. Samples with extremes total intensities might indicate sample degradation or technical errors and these samples were excluded. Third, an ANOVA-type normalization was used to take into account factors of unwanted variation. Specifically, we fitted a linear regression for association between each feature intensity and several factors of unwanted variability. We then used the residuals from the regression as new feature intensities. The factors of unwanted variability can be identified by studying the association between several technical variables and the first principal components. In TwinGene we adjusted for the square root of the sum of the squared differences between original retention time and corrected retention time, analysis date, storage time and unknown cluster effect. Finally, feature intensities were averaged between technical duplicates to reduce the inherent instrumental variability. Features with poor correlation between duplicates were excluded.

cancer causes more deaths in men and women than any other cancer related disease. Currently, few effective strategies exist to predict how patients will respond to treatment. We evaluated the serum metabolomic profiles of 25 lung cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy \u00b1 radiation to evaluate the feasibility of metabolites as temporal biomarkers of clinical outcomes . Methods: Serial serum specimens collected prospectively from lung cancer patients were analyzed using both nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Multivariate statistical analysis consisted of unsupervised principal component analysis or orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis with significance assessed using a cross-validated ANOVA. Results: The metabolite profiles were reflective of the temporal distinction between patient samples before during and after receiving therapy (1H-NMR p<0.001 and GC-MS p<0.01). Disease progression and survival were strongly correlative with the GC-MS metabolite data whereas stage and cancer type were associated with 1H-NMR data. Metabolites such as hydroxylamine, tridecan-1-ol, octadecan-1-ol, were indicative of survival (GC-MS p<0.05) and metabolites such as tagatose, hydroxylamine, glucopyranose, and threonine that were reflective of progression (GC-MS p<0.05). Conclusions: Metabolite profiles have the potential to act as prognostic markers of clinical outcomes for lung cancer patients. Serial 1H-NMR measurements appear to detect metabolites diagnostic of tumor pathology, while GC-MS provided data better related to prognostic clinical outcomes warranting further study in a larger cohort and with various treatment options.","Sample collection: Serum specimens were collected at pre-specified time-points: prior to treatment, during treatment, and at 6 mth post-treatment. Blood was collected by venipuncture, centrifuged at 1500 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and separated within 24 h of collection then stored at -80 \u00b0C until 1H-NMR and GC\u2013MS analysis. Patients were not fasting at the time of blood sampling. In total, analyzed 134 serum samples were analyzed.","Extraction: Sample preparation for the GC-MS consisted of three basic steps: deproteinization, methoxiamination and finally derivitization. Deproteinization is able to remove the interference from proteins such as albumin, which are present in a large concentration in blood. For GC-MS metabolite extraction, samples were thawed on ice and 50 \u00b5l of sample used for extraction using chloroform: methanol procedure. Aqueous metabolites were dried under vacuum, and then derivitized using methoxyamine and MSTFA.","Sample collection: 1H-NMR spectroscopy was performed using a protocol previously described [1]. For NMR analysis, serum samples were thawed in ice. 350 \u00b5l of serum sample were filtered through a prewashed Nanasep 3K Omega Filter Eppendorf to remove high molecular weight (>3kDa) compounds (e.g. large proteins, lipid complexes etc.). After centrifugation, samples were buffered to a pH of 7.0 for analysis. Ref: [1]: Weljie A. M., Dowlatabadi R., Miller B. J., Vogel H. J., & Jirik F. R. (2007). An inflammatory arthritis-associated metabolite biomarker pattern revealed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. J Proteome Res, 6(9), 3456-3464. doi: 10.1021\/pr070123j ","Nmr spec: Regular one-dimensional proton NMR spectra were obtained using a 600-MHz Bruker Ultrashield NMR spectrometer equipped with a TXI probe (5 mm) (Bruker Biospin, Milton, Canada).","Nmr assay: The spectra were acquired using a standard pulse sequence that had good water suppression characteristics and is commonly used for metabolite profiling of serum samples. Relaxation delay of 1s was used; t1 was set to 4 \u00b5s and tm had a value of 100 ms. Initial samples for each batch were shimmed to ensure half-height line width of <1.1 Hz for the dimethyly-silapentane-sulphonate peak, calibrated to 0.0 ppm. A 1D NOESY presaturation pulse sequence was used to analyze the samples. Spectra were acquired with 1024 scans, then zero filled and Fourier transformed to 128k data points using the Chenomx NMRSuite processor.","Chromatography: GC-MS was performed on an Agilent chromatograph 7890A (Agilent Technologies Canada Inc, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using a 30m DB-5 column (Non-polar with very low bleed characteristics)as previously described [1].

Serum metabolomic profile as a means to distinguish stage of colorectal cancer. Genome Med, 4(5), 42. doi: 10.1186\/gm341 ","Mass spec: Mass spectral data was acquired using a Waters GCT mass spectrometer coupled with an Agilent chromatograph 7890A (Agilent Technologies Canada Inc, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) using GC-TOF-MS methodology. Metabolites were scanned in a positive mode with a range of 50 to 800 m\/z.","Data transformation: Raw data from 1H-NMR was processed and profiled using Chenomx NMR Suite 7.1 to a library of 55 compounds. 1H-NMR spectral data was evaluated using the strategy of \u2018targeted profiling\u2019[1]. This allows quantification of metabolite concentrations in the samples. Raw data from GC-MS was imported to the Metabolite Detector for peak detection [2]. The pre-processed data was exported to multi-variate statistical analytical software SIMCA-P 13+ and analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). Univariate scaling is applied to overcome the dominating effect of higher intensity metabolite features. Thus scaling gives equal importance to all the components. Logarithmic transformation was also done before analysis to reduce the effect of data skewness. PCA was performed to check the unsupervised segregation of the metabolome. OPLS-DA allowed us to discriminate between the different variables concerning the cancers in context. Model significance was assessed using a cross-validated ANOVA with p = 0.05 considered significant. Variables were selected according to the VIP (variable influence on projection) as previously described [3], which are reflective of the correlation of the metabolites towards different response. VIP > 1 was considered significant. Ref: [1]: Weljie, A. M., Newton, J., Mercier, P., Carlson, E., & Slupsky, C. M. (2006). Targeted profiling: quantitative analysis of 1H NMR metabolomics data.

","Metabolite id: Additional 2-dimensional NMR experiments were performed for the purpose of confirming chemical shift assignments, including homonuclear total correlation spectroscopy (2D 1H-1H TOCSY) and heteronuclear single quantum coherence spectroscopy (2D 1H-13C HSQC), using standard Bruker pulse programs. To elucidate the relative changes of significant metabolites before, during and after therapy, significance of analysis of microarrays (SAM) with time course analysis was performed [1]. This analysis was applied independently to both GC-MS and 1H-NMR metabolite datasets [2]. Metabolites were considered significant with a corrected p-value <0.05 and false discovery rate of 10% to account for multiple testing. We further investigated if specific clinical and outcome factors, included variables such as cancer type (NSCLC and SCLC), cancer staging (stages 1 to 4), time-point(s) of sample collection, survival and progression could be predicted by the GC-MS and 1H-NMR datasets.

As a consequence, characterization of the variations of the urine metabolome under basal conditions becomes critical in order to avoid confounding effects in cohort studies. Such physiological information is however very scarce in the literature and in metabolomics databases so far. Here we studied the influence of age, body mass index (BMI), and gender on metabolite concentrations in a large cohort of 183 adults by using liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). We implemented a comprehensive statistical workflow for univariate hypothesis testing and modeling by orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS).<\/br> This repository contains the data set from the negative ionization mode: 2 batches, 234 files (24 blanks + 26 QCs + 184 samples) in the Thermo .RAW (6.8 Go) and .mzML (18 Go) formats. The comprehensive analysis of this data set is publicly available on the Workflow4metabolomics.org e-infrastructure with two reference histories: 'W4M00002_Sacurine-comprehensive' corresponds to the preprocessing of the .mzML files, followed by signal drift and batch effect correction, normalization, filtering, statistics, and annotation of the peak table; 'W4M00001_Sacurine- statistics' starts with the peak table restricted to the 113 identified metabolites (see Roux et al. [1] for a full description and information about the annotation), and contains the statistical analysis (as described in associated publication except that the publication also describes the positive ionization mode). The intensities of the table provided in the m_sacurine.txt ISA file correspond to the peak table restricted to the 113 identified metabolites (i.e. are identical to the input of the 'W4M00001_Sacurine-statistics' history). Note that in both histories, the HU_096 sample is filtered out during the Hotelling\/Quantile\/MissingValue quality control sample filter, leading to 183 samples for the subsequent statistical analyzes. Notes: The 'sampling' field indicates the 9 successive weeks during which samples were collected. The 'subset' field indicates a subset of 36 files (6 blanks + 10 QCs + 20 samples) which still contain significant physiological variations (and can be used as e.g. demo or teaching material).<\/br> Acknowledgements: The authors are grateful to Philippe Rocca-Serra for his help in preparing the ISA files.<\/br> <\/p> Ref:<\/br> [1] Roux A, Xu Y, Heilier JF, Olivier MF, Ezan E, Tabet JC, Junot C. 2012.

Anal Chem. Aug 7;84(15):6429-37. doi: 10.1021\/ac300829f.","Sample collection: Urine samples were collected from a cohort of 189 human adults during their routine examination as employees working at the CEA reseach center of Saclay. Sample collection was performed with informed consent of the subjects, in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments. Five volunteers with high BMI values (from 32.9 to 41.3 kg\/m2) were not included since these values were considered extreme (as confirmed by significant p-values with the Grubbs outlier test) and representative of too few subjects to provide robust statistical information. An additional sample was further discarded after normalization due to outlier values in the negative ionization mode, leading to 183 individual samples under study.","Sample preparation: The experimental protocol has been described previously ('439020'study; [1]). Briefly, urine samples were centrifuged (1430g for 5 min) and then diluted in deionized water (dilution 1\/5, 20 \u00b5l of urine in 80 \u00b5l of water) before analysis. Samples were randomly analyzed. A quality control sample consisting of a pool of urine samples analyzed in the course of this study was injected every 10 samples to check for the performance of the analytical system in terms of retention times, accurate mass measurements, and signal intensities.

Anal Chem. Aug 7;84(15):6429-37. doi: 10.1021\/ac300829f.","Chromatography: An Accela liquid chromatographic system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) was used. The ultrahigh performance liquid chromatographic (UHPLC) separation was performed on a Hypersil GOLD C18 1.9 \u00b5m, 2.1 mm x 150 mm column (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France). The flow rate was 0.5 ml\/min with mobile phases A (100% water) and B (100% acetonitrile), both containing 0.1% formic acid. The gradient consisted of an isocratic step of 2 min at 100% phase A, followed by a linear gradient from 0% to 100% of phase B for the next 11 min, before returning to 100% A in 0.5 min. The column was then allowed to equilibrate for 3.5 min.","Mass spec: The liquid chromatographic system was coupled to an LTQ-Orbitrap Discovery (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Villebon-sur-Yvette, France) fitted with an electrospray (ESI) source. The mass resolution of the spectrometer was 30,000 (m\/dm at 400 u) and he mass accuracy was within a 5 ppm range. In the negative ionization mode, samples were analyzed in two batches (ne1 and ne2). The ESI source was cleaned between ne1 and ne2. The same quality control (QC) sample for all batches (mix of urines from a subset of the cohort) was injected regularly throughout the run after every ten samples of interest.","Preprocessing: Peak detection, grouping, and retention time correction with the XCMS software resulted in two peak tables (one for each ionization mode). After metabolite identification, peak integration was performed with the Quan Browser module from the Xcalibur software (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after visual checking of the retention time limits, in order to refine signal quantitation and avoid any bias that may have occurred during the initial XCMS procedure. The few missing values in the pos and neg peak tables (less than 2%) were replaced by half the minimum of the non missing values (results without replacement of missing values were similar).","Data analysis: 1) Signal Drift Correction and Batch Effect Removal: Within each peak table, intensities were corrected for signal drift and batch effect by fitting a locally quadratic (loess) regression model to the QC values. The parameter controlling the smoothing was set to 1 to avoid overfitting. Once the peak tables were normalized, metabolites with a coefficient of variation (CV) of their QC values >30% (which was the case for 10% and 4% of the features of the pos and neg tables, respectively) were filtered out. 2) Normalization and Quality Control: Each urine profile was normalized to the osmolality of the sample. The two peak tables were subsequently log10 transformed. One sample with both an extreme intensity distribution quantile (p < 10-15) and an extreme Hotelling's T2 distance in the PCA score plot (p < 10-15) in the negative ionization mode, was discarded. 3) Univariate Statistical Analysis: Correlations with age and BMI covariates were assessed with the Spearman rank correlation test, and the Wilcoxon (Mann-Whitney) test was used for the comparison of gender distributions. The p-values were adjusted for multiple comparison by controlling the false discovery rate (proportion of false positives among the metabolites called significant) at a 5% threshold. 4) Multivariate Modeling: The ropls R package implements the PCA, PLS(-DA) and OPLS(-DA) approaches with the original, NIPALS-based, versions of the algorithms. It includes the R2 and Q2 quality metrics, the permutation diagnostics, the computation of the VIP values, the score and orthogonal distances to detect outliers, as well as many graphics (scores, loadings, predictions, diagnostics, outliers, etc.). The ropls package is available from the Bioconductor repository. The number of orthogonal components of the OPLS models for the age, BMI, and gender responses, as assessed by the Q2Y metrics, was 1, 1, and 3, respectively. The variables were standardized (i.e., mean-centered and unit-variance scaled) prior to model building as it resulted in the highest Q2Y (results with Pareto scaling were similar). 5) Correlation Networks and Hierarchical Clustering: The Spearman correlation coefficient (cor_spe) was used as the measure of similarity between metabolite profiles among individuals. Only edges corresponding to an absolute correlation >0.5 are shown. Hierarchical clustering of individuals and metabolites were performed using 1-cor_spe as the dissimilarity, and the Ward's linkage method. 6) Software: All computational modules (for data normalization, quality control, univariate testing and multivariate modeling) were written in R (version 3.0.2) and integrated into the Workflow4Metabolomics.org online resource for computational metabolomics.","Metabolite id: Annotation was performed by using our in-house ESI-mass spectra database, as well as the HMDB, KEGG, and METLIN public databases, and identities were confirmed with additional MS\/MS experiments when required.

Here we used high temporal resolution metabolite profiling to determine circadian regulation of mouse liver and cell autonomous metabolism. In mouse liver, we found ~50% of metabolites were circadian, with strong enrichment of the nucleotide, amino acid, and methylation pathways. In U2OS cells, 27% of metabolites were circadian, including amino acids and NAD biosynthesis, also clock controlled in liver. To assess whether cell autonomous metabolite rhythms were clock-dependent, we used RNAi to perturb Bmal1, Cry1, and Cry2. Bmal1 knockdown eliminated most metabolite rhythms, while Cry1 generally shortened and Cry2 lengthened rhythms. Surprisingly, we found Cry1 knockdown induced 8 hr rhythms in amino acid, methylation, and vitamin metabolites, decoupling metabolite and transcriptional rhythms. These results provide the first comprehensive views of circadian liver and cell autonomous metabolism.","Sample collection: Animal preparation and liver collection:Mice were prepared as previously described [1][2]. Briefly, C57BL\/6 mice of 6-wk-old male were acquired from Jackson Labs, entrained to a 12 hr:12 hr light:dark schedule for 1 wk. After 18 h of constant darkness, 3 mice were killed in the dark for every hr, for 48 hr. Liver samples were quickly excised and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Food and water were supplied ad libitum at all stages. All procedures were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Cell autonomus U2OS cell collection: Cells were prepared as previously described [3]. Briefly, U2OS cells were seeded at 150,000 cells per 35-mm dishes in DMEM medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. Cells were transfected with 12 pmol of siRNA using Lipofectamine RNAiMax transfection reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. A negative control siRNA (AllStars Negative control siRNA; Qiagen) was used to ensure equal molar amounts of Bmal1, Cry1 and Cry2 siRNA were added in each condition. Cells were plated 4 days prior to synchronization and allowed to grow to confluence. Cells were synchronized with 0.1 \u00b5M dexamethasone. The collection began 48 hr post-synchronization. During the collection, cell pellets were collected and snap frozen every 2 hr for a total of 48 hr [4].<br\/> Ref:<br\/>[1] Hughes ME, DiTacchio L, Hayes KR, Vollmers C, Pulivarthy S, Baggs JE, Panda S, Hogenesch JB.

In parallel to the FT acquisition, 4 data dependent MS\/MS scans were collected at nominal mass resolution in the ion trap (LTQ). Samples were analyzed in random order with a pooled sampled run every 6 samples in order to assess instrument variability.","Data transformation: Targeted metabolomics data: The resulting data were converted to mzML files using the msConvert tool[1] and processed with MAVEN[2]. The concentration of the metabolites in the targeted mass spectrometry data is given in ng\/ml. Untargeted metabolomics data were collected as XCalibur RAW files which were converted to mzXML files using the msConvert tool within ProteoWizard[1]. Features were extracted from the LC-MS data using XCMS[3], where a feature is defined as a unique combination of a mass-to-charge (m\/z) ratio and a retention time. Peak finding was performed with the centWave algorithm[4], and only peaks that fit a Gaussian shape were retained. Features were aligned across samples based on retention time and m\/z value using the group.nearest function in XCMS; fillPeaks was used to reconsider features missed in the initial peak finding steps. CAMERA was used 1) to find compounds differing by adduct ion and stable isotope composition[5] and 2) to extract the intensities and m\/z values for the associated MS\/MS spectra.

Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments. Here, we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolite profilings of complete shoots (pooling leaves, petioles and stems) to compare the extremophile Lotus creticus, adapted to highly saline coastal regions, and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species, Lotus corniculatus and Lotus tenuis. L. creticus exhibited better survival after exposure to long-term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl- from the shoots than the glycophytes. In contrast, Na+ levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress, a trait often observed in halophytes. Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure. Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L. creticus shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes, providing little evidence for metabolic pre-adaptation to salinity. This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non-extremophile legumes, and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre-adaptation hypothesis.","Sample collection: L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http:\/\/www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16\/8 h day\/night, 23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and 55\u201365% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples. Ref: [1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

Although acute toxicity has been shown in vitro and in vivo, there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the molecular mechanism of AgNP-induced toxicity. Much of the current literature centres on the question of whether toxicity is induced by the AgNPs themselves or by ionic silver released from the nanoparticle surface. Here, I present research investigating AgNP toxicity to Daphnia magna, a keystone species of freshwater ecosystems the world over, using a multi-omics platform of transcriptomics and metabolomics techniques. Initially, the AgNPs were fully characterised and the exposure conditions optimised to accurately assess the impact of AgNP exposure to D. magna. This allowed for the design of sub-lethal AgNP exposures that had been fully controlled for the fraction of dissolved silver ions. Secondly, using this multi-omics platform, the role of Ag+ ions in AgNP toxicity to D. magna was determined. Finally a metabolic pathway perturbed by AgNP exposure was identified, as well as two constituent metabolites of key importance. Overall, this research advances the mechanistic understanding of AgNP toxicity to aquatic organisms, and further highlights the need for greater consideration of the nanoscale in regulative legislature.","Sample collection: Nominal exposure concentrations of 4.70, 2.35, 1.18 and 0.59 \u03bcg\/l AgNPs (AgNP High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively) were alongside nominal concentrations of 0.44, 0.22, 0.11 and 0.06 \u00b5g\/l AgNO3 (Ag+ High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively). These exposure concentrations of AgNO3 equate to 0.28, 0.14, 0.07 and 0.04 \u03bcg\/l of total Ag+ ions (Ag+ High, Mid, Low and V. Low respectively) corresponding to 6 % of the respective AgNP exposures. Untreated (deionised water; no-added silver), capping agent (0.03 % v\/v. PVP) and bulk silver (4.7 \u03bcg\/l, 3\u03bcm average diameter, Sigma Aldrich) controls were used to account for background mortality, any potential impact of the capping agent, and to control for potential aggregation effects respectively. The dissolved Ag filtered from the AgNP stock prior to use was included as an additional filtrate control. Each biological replicate consisted of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) with 6 biological replicates per treatment group with the exception of AgNP High which had 8 replicates to account for potential mortalities induced by the higher concentration. Groups of 30 D. magna neonates (<24 h) were added to individual exposure vessels (250 ml glass beaker, Fisher Scientific) containing 200 ml of medium (adjusted to pH 7.0). The appropriate exposure stock (1 ml) was then used to spike the study medium followed immediately by 49 ml of additional medium to mix. Exposure vessels were kept at 19 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C and on a 16 h:8 h light:dark cycle with no additional food or supplements administered. Tests were only considered valid if no more than 10% of control animals were immobilised during the exposure. Following exposure, animals were filtered from their medium into a precellys tube, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to extraction.","Extraction: Frozen animals (30 neonates per sample) were homogenised using a Precellys-24 ceramic bead-based homogeniser (Stretton Scientific Ltd., UK) in 448 \u03bcl of a 5:2 mix of methanol (HPLC grade): water (nuclease free, QIAGEN) for two 15 s bursts at 10,000 rpm with a 10 s intermission. A 112 \u03bcl aliquot of homogenate was then removed into a nuclease-free microfuge tube (1.7 ml, Axygen) for RNA extraction and replaced with the same volume of 5:2 methanol:water. Polar metabolites were extracted from the remaining homogenate using a two-step, biphasic method as detailed previously [1]. Following extraction, the upper, polar layer of each sample was removed into a single 1.5 ml microfuge tube (Starstedt, Leicester, UK) via Hamilton syringe. Polar extracts were dried under vacuum (Savant Refrigerated Vapour Trap, Thermo Scientific) using a centrifugal concentrator (Savant SpeedVac concentrator, Thermo Scientific) without application of heat and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to FT-ICR analysis. Two extract blanks were created using the above homogenisation and extraction protocols in the absence of biological material. Ref: [1] Wu H, Southam AD, Hines A, Viant MR.

All re-suspended samples were centrifuged at 22,000 rcf, 4 \u00b0C for 10 minutes to remove particulate matter. The supernatant of each sample was then loaded alongside quality control (QC) samples in a randomly generated order on 384 well plates (Agilent technologies). QC samples were created from a pool of D. magna polar extract from a separately collected group of neonates. Once an entire plate was loaded, it was permanently sealed using a single, heat-sealed, foil sheet (ALPS 50V, Thermo Fisher Scientific, US). All extracts were analysed in quadruplicate using an LTQ-FT Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) hybrid LTQ FT-ICR mass spectrometer with a direct infusion, chip-based nano-electrospray ionisation source (Triversa, Advion Biosciences, Ithaca, NY). Nanoelectrospray conditions consisted of a 200 nl\/min flow rate, 0.3 psi backing pressure and an electrospray voltage of either +1.7 kV or -1.7 kV in positive or negative ion mode respectively controlled by Chipsoft software (Advion, Ithaca, NY, USA). An automatic gain control setting of 1x106 was used in combination with a mass resolution of 100,000 (FWHM at 400 m\/z). Each technical replicate was analysed using Xcalibur software (Version, Thermo Scientific). Data were acquired as transients from m\/z 70-590 using the selected ion monitoring (SIM) stitching methodology [1][2][3] in 7 SIM windows of 100 m\/z width and 30 m\/z overlap.

Briefly, transients were averaged and then transformed into spectra with Fast Fourier Transform [3] and calibrated using a list of defined peaks for each SIM window (Section 9.3). SIM window spectra were then \u2018stitched\u2019 together through the alignment of peaks in overlapping regions (30 Da) using the SIM-stitching algorithm [1]. All peaks with intensities with a signal to noise ratio of less than 3.5 were removed, as were areas of \u2018mechanical noise\u2019 or \u2018high noise regions\u2019 in the m\/z ranges of (m\/z = (74.05-74.2); (90.50-90.58), (101.32-101.42); (101.6-102.1); (105.1-105.5); and (116.37 116.5)). This process resulted in four stitched spectra per biological sample; the three best quality replicates were then selected for further filtering. Replicate quality was primarily based on the variation of relative intensity within SIM windows. The spectra of the three selected technical replicates were then aligned and merged, with peaks being retained only if present in at least two of the remaining three replicates, thus resulting in one spectrum per biological sample. When aligning replicate spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 1.5 ppm error of one another along the m\/z axis. The spectra of all samples were then aligned and filtered with m\/z peaks only being retained if they were present in at least 80% of all experimental samples. Due to the differing origin of the QC samples, they were excluded from this process to avoid skewing the filter. When aligning sample spectra, peaks were considered to be the same if they occurred within a 2.5 ppm error of one another along the m\/z axis. Any of the remaining sample peaks which were also detected within the extract blanks were removed from all spectra. All spectral processing steps were completed in MATLAB (student version 7, The Math-Works, Natick, MA). These processing steps yield a matrix of raw peak intensity values, with columns corresponding to m\/z values and rows corresponding to samples, which require further processing before statistical analysis. Glog transformation Peaks of naturally higher intensities are intrinsically prone to greater technical variation, in terms of absolute values, than those which are naturally lower in intensity. This can skew the results of multivariate statistical analysis. To counteract this, the normalised matrix was transformed using the generalised logarithm transformation [4]. This process uses a scaling factor (\u03bb) derived from the QC samples i.e. samples between which, theoretically, the only variation is technical and not biological. This process stabilises technical variation and reduces dominance of large intensity peaks, allows for better observation of biological differences in subsequent multivariate statistical analyses such as PCA ([4].PQN normalisation To account for variation arising from differences in sample concentration, the resulting filtered matrix was normalised via Probable Quotient Normalisation (PQN) [5] using an in-house MATLAB script. We calculate qQuotients of dilution were calculated, by dividing the intensity of each peak in a spectrum by the mean intensity for that peak across all samples. The median quotient of the entire spectrum is then selected as the scaling factor (most probable quotient) for that spectrum. Quotients were only calculated for peaks that occurred in 100 % of all samples except QCs. To prevent miscalculation of fold changes, missing values were imputed using the k-nearest neighbour (KNN) algorithm using an in-house MATLAB script [6]. Briefly, the top k (in this study k=5) peaks with the most similar intensity profiles across all samples were used to calculate a weighted average (the most similar peaks being favoured) for that sample. This value was then imputed in the place of the missing value. This normalised matrix with imputed missing values was used for the assessment of fold changes in peak intensities across groups and for univariate analysis to determine significantly changing peaks.

Initially, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, which provided a rapid, high-throughput metabolic fingerprint of P. putida strains, was used to investigate any phenotypic changes resulting from exposure to toluene. Principal component discriminant function analysis (PC-DFA) allowed the differentiation between different conditions of toluene on bacterial cells, which indicated phenotypic changes associated with the presence of the solvent within the cell. Examination of PC-DFA loading plots suggested that the protein and fatty acids groups were responsible for discrimination of responses by P. putida strains to toluene. To identify metabolites of interest, the polar extracts of P. putida cells were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and 15 metabolites of P. putida central metabolic pathways were detected. Multi-block principal component analysis (MB-PCA) indicated that P. putida cultures challenged with toluene were differentially clustered away from the non-challenged cells. Investigation of MB-PCA loading plots and N-way ANOVA for condition | strain\u00d7time blocking (dosage of toluene) suggested ornithine as the most significant compound that increased upon solvent exposure. Ornithine presents itself as a major feature which may have important functions in toluene stress tolerance mechanisms.","Sample collection: 1. Bacterial strains and culture medium Three strains of P. putida were chosen for this study to investigate the response of bacteria to toluene stress, sourced from the Juan Luis Ramos lab (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas, Estacion Experimental del Zaidin, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular and Cellular Biology of Plants, Granada, Spain, http:\/\/www.eez.csic.es\/?q=en\/node\/51). Nutrient agar (NA) and Lysogeny broth (LB) were used for cultivation of bacteria. NA was prepared as follows: peptone 5 g\/l, beef extract 3 g\/l, sodium chloride 8 g\/l, 12 g\/l of agar no. 2. LB medium contained: tryptone 10 g\/l (Formedia, Hunstanton,UK), yeast extract 5 g\/l (USP, Cleveland, USA) and NaCl 10 g\/l. 2. Cultivation of bacteria and culture conditions P. putida DOT-T1E strains were sub-cultured in triplicate on agar plates in order to obtain pure single colonies. Cells were grown in LB and the cultures were incubated overnight with horizontal shaking in an orbital incubator (Infors HT Ltd, UK) at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm. 3. Growth in response to toluene, sample collection and analysis P. putida cells were incubated in an orbital shaker for 1 h at 30 \u00b0C and 200 rpm. At this point, cultures were divided into two groups: one was kept as a control and the other exposed to toluene supplied as gas phase via an evaporation tube (to avoid direct contact with the culture) containing 100 \u00b5l of toluene for 30 min. The culture flasks containing 50 ml of LB medium were sealed with Suba-Seal to prevent toluene leakage and then incubated for an additional 4 h. The concentration of toluene in the flask was approximately 12.5 mM (0.125% (v\/v)) under these culture conditions. Once cell cultures reached the mid-log phase, the cultures were split into two halves; to one 0.1% (v\/v) toluene was added and the other was kept as control, and incubated for additional 7 h. The tested concentration of toluene is below the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) which are 5, 0.8 and 0.7% (v\/v) for DOT-T1E, DOT-T1E-PS28 and DOT-T1E-18 respectively. 4.Sample collection and metabolic quenching Samples were collected as 15 ml aliquots at several time points (0, 10 and 60 min) in the absence and presence of different toluene conditions (0 min refer to the point immediately before the addition of toluene shock). The metabolic activity of the collected samples were immediately quenched by adding 30 ml of cold (-50 \u00b0C) 60% methanol followed by centrifugation at 3000 \u00d7g for 10 min at 1 \u00b0C. After the centrifugation the supernatant was discarded, while the cell pellets were stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to metabolite extraction [1].

The samples were then pelleted by centrifugation (13500 \u00d7g, 3 min, 4 \u00b0C) and the supernatant stored on dry ice. This procedure was undertaken twice on the cell pellets and both extracts were combined and kept on dry ice.A 1400 \u00b5l aliquot of intracellular extracts were normalised according to OD660, followed by the preparation of a quality control (QC) sample [1][2].

Recently, LC\/MS-based untargeted metabolomics and isotopically labeled metabolites have been used to facilitate the unbiased mapping of labeled moieties through metabolic pathways. However, due to the complexity of the resulting experimental data sets few computational tools are available for data analysis. Here we introduce geoRge, a novel computational approach capable of analyzing untargeted LC\/MS data from stable isotope-labeling experiments. geoRge is written in the open language R and runs on the output structure of the XCMS package, which is in widespread use. As opposed to the few existing tools, which use labeled samples to track stable isotopes by iterating over all MS signals using the theoretical mass difference between the light and heavy isotopes, geoRge uses unlabeled and labeled biologically equivalent samples to compare isotopic distributions in the mass spectra. Isotopically enriched compounds change their isotopic distribution as compared to unlabeled compounds. This is directly reflected in a number of new m\/z peaks and higher intensity peaks in the mass spectra of labeled samples relative to the unlabeled equivalents. The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative quantification capabilities of geoRge are demonstrated by the analysis of LC\/MS data from a human retinal pigment epithelium cell line (ARPE-19) grown on normal and high glucose concentrations mimicking diabetic retinopathy conditions in vitro. In addition, we compared the results of geoRge with the outcome of X(13)CMS, since both approaches rely entirely on XCMS parameters for feature selection, namely m\/z and retention time values. geoRge is available as an R script at https:\/\/github.com\/jcapelladesto\/geoRge.","Sample collection: Cells were cultured under standard conditions in DMEM\/F12 (1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12), 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and penicillin\/streptomycin. ARPE19 cells from passage 2023 were used and the media was changed every 3 days. Cells grown in these conditions constitute a monolayer that retains the functionality, polarity and tight junction expression of the human RPE6. For our study, cells were seeded in Petri dishes (10 cm) at 0.4 x 10^4 cells\/ml and maintained in culture for 21 days with 5.5 mM or 25 mM of D-Glucose at 37 \u00b0C under 5% (v\/v) CO2 in an incubator. During the last 24 hours cells were subjected to serum deprivation (1% FCS). Serum deprived media were prepared with 5.5 mM or 25 mM of either D-Glucose or D-[U 13C] Glucose. Each condition was run in triplicate.","Extraction: The culture medium was removed from cells and the dishes were placed on top of dry ice. Cells were scraped immediately and metabolites extracted into the extraction solvent by adding 2 ml of a cold mixture of chloroform\/methanol (2:1 v\/v).

Understanding salt tolerance mechanisms will contribute to the discovery of new traits which may enhance the breeding efforts towards improved performance of legumes in marginal agricultural environments. Here, we used a combination of ionomic and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolite profilings of complete shoots (pooling leaves, petioles and stems) to compare the extremophile Lotus creticus, adapted to highly saline coastal regions, and two cultivated glycophytic grassland forage species, Lotus corniculatus and Lotus tenuis. L. creticus exhibited better survival after exposure to long-term lethal salinity and was more efficient at excluding Cl- from the shoots than the glycophytes. In contrast, Na+ levels were higher in the extremophile under both control and salt stress, a trait often observed in halophytes. Ionomics demonstrated a differential rearrangement of shoot nutrient levels in the extremophile upon salt exposure. Metabolite profiling showed that responses to NaCl in L. creticus shoots were globally similar to those of the glycophytes, providing little evidence for metabolic pre-adaptation to salinity. This study is the first comparing salt acclimation responses between extremophile and non-extremophile legumes, and challenges the generalization of the metabolic salt pre-adaptation hypothesis.","Sample collection: L. creticus seeds were kindly provided by the Servicio Devesa-Albufera Ayuntamiento de Valencia, Viveros Municipales de El Saler, CV-500, Km 8.5, El Saler, Valencia (Spain). L. corniculatus var. San Gabriel and L. tenius (Lotus glaber) var. La Esmeralda were obtained from the LOTASSA consortium (http:\/\/www.lotassa.com). Seeds were germinated in plates containing half-strength BD agar [1] plus 2 mm KNO3 and 2 mm NH4NO3. For the evaluation of survival to long-term lethal NaCl levels, seedlings (at least 40 of each species) were transplanted to pots containing a mixture of sand and perlite (1:1) irrigated with nutrient solution, and grown in the greenhouse under a 16\/8 h day\/night, 23 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C and 55\u201365% relative humidity regime. Eight days post-imbibition, the salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in 25 mm NaCl steps every three days to reach 300 mm NaCl. This concentration was used to continue irrigation, until all the plants died. The number of dead plants as a function of time was recorded. Plants were scored dead when the whole plant or all the leaves were wilted or chlorotic. For the gradual salt stress acclimation experiments, seedlings were transplanted to soil (type Null Einheitserde, Wandorf, Germany) and irrigated with nutrient solution. The stress treatment was started 8 days post-imbibition. The salt concentration in the nutrient solution was increased in three steps of 4 day intervals from 50, 100 to 150 mm NaCl [2]. In two successive independent experiments, L. creticus was tested parallel to the other Lotus species. Each independent experiment included sample sets of control and salt-treated plants. Each sample set had at least five independent biological replicates and each replicate was a pool of at least five plants. The total duration of the cultivation was 32 d. Complete shoots, pools of leaves, petioles and stems omitting cotyledons were harvested in situ in the middle of the light period and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. The experimental design induced neither senescence nor was lethal within the cultivation period. At harvest, all plants were still in the vegetative stage and non-nodulated. Biomass was estimated by the mean fresh weight of the pooled shoot samples. Ref: [1] Broughton W.J. & Dilworth M.J. (1971) Control of leghaemoglobin synthesis in snake beans.

Injection of a 1 \u00b5l sample is performed at 230 \u00b0C in splitless mode with helium carrier gas flow set to 0.6 ml\/min. Purge time is 1 min at 20 ml\/min flow. The flow rate is kept constant with electronic pressure control enabled. Optionally and especially recommended in cases of high metabolite concentrations, injection is performed in split mode with the split ratio adjusted 1:25. As a rule of thumb, split injection may be prone to discrimination of high-boiling metabolic components, whereas splitless injection may, in rare cases, result in peak shape artifacts for low-boiling components. These artifacts occur in few chromatograms and result in different degrees of peak splitting and shoulder formation. For suppression of this peak shape artifact either inject at decreased flow or apply a 2 min pressure pulse at 110 psi during injection. However, a robust suppression of this artifact for all biological samples can currently not be recommended. The temperature program starts in isothermal mode set to 1 min at 70 \u00b0C. The isothermal step is followed by a 9 \u00b0C\/min ramp to 350 \u00b0C. The final temperature is kept constant for 5 min. Cooling is performed as fast as instrument specifications allow.

Triso) and 13 associated weed species were exposed in a chamberless mini-FACE system. The field site contains 15 circular field plots (2 m diameter) and is located at Heidfeldhof, a farm managed by the Plant Breeding Station of the University of Hohenheim (9 Degrees 11 minutes E, 48 Degrees 42 Minutes N, 395 m asl), south of Stuttgart (Germany). In each of the 3 years, the plots with local soil (slightly stagnic luvisol) were manually dug to a depth of 30 cm at the end of March. Wheat as the main crop was sown in lines at a spacing of 15 cm, seed distance of 1.5 cm and depth of 2 cm to a density of 200 plants\/sqm. Based on agronomic practice recommended for spring wheat, the plots were fertilised with 140 kg nitrogen (N)\/ha, 30 kg phosphorus (P)\/ha and 60 kg potassium (K)\/ha at 50 \/ 25 \/ 25% at different development stages of the plants (EC 13\u201329, EC 30\u201339 and EC 40\u201359; [1]). In addition, on EC 30\u201339, a trace element fertiliser was applied containing 0.03 kg boron (B) \/ha, 0.45 kg magnesium (Mg)\/ha, 0.36 kg sulphur (S)\/ha and 0.03 kg manganese (Mn)\/ha. Soil moisture was measured using time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors (IMKO, Ettlingen, Germany). Plots were manually irrigated, if necessary, with the same amount of water applied to all treatments. Irrigation volumes were noted and taken into account for calculation of total water supply, including precipitation amounts. The CO2 exposure involved three treatments with five replicates each: (i) CONTROL plots with ambient air CO2 concentration without technical equipment, (ii) AMBIENT plots with ambient air CO2 concentration and the frame system (AMB), and (iii) FACE plots with elevated CO2 concentration and the frame system (ELE). The exposure started before seed emergence and continued until final harvest. To achieve a target gas concentration of 150 \u00b5l\/l above AMBIENT (24 hr average), pure CO2 was released directly into the plant canopy through an injection system and regulated according to wind direction and velocity to maintain the set concentration. The CO2 concentrations achieved at canopy height were monitored in the centre of each field plot. Additional information on the performance of the system is given elsewhere ([2][3][4]). Wheat plants from the central square metre of each plot were harvested at crop maturity and separated into leaves, stems and ears. Dry weights (DW) of the different biomass fractions were determined after drying until constant weight (leaf and stem at 60 \u00baC, ear at room temperature). Ear numbers were counted and grains were extracted from the ears. Total grain weights were measured and thousand grain weights (TGW) were determined using a seed counter (Condator \"E\", Pfeuffer, Winnenden, Germany).

In order to assess the grouping performance, we performed a peak detection with XCMS [1], using the matched filter method with a signal-to-noise ratio of 5 and full-width at half height of 5 in order to find well represented peaks. The peak finding step reported between 410 and 465 peaks per chromatogram. The apex scan indices for each chromatogram's peaks were stored in one tab separated value file for each chromatogram. We chose signals as reported from the Data Transformation\/Peak Finding step within a retention time window of +\/- 30 s. To be counted as a complete group, the scans corresponding to the tags were required to have a pairwise cosine similarity between their binned mass spectra of >0.99 throughout all chromatograms and a maximum mass deviation of 0.01 Dalton. The selection process lead to 184 peak groups containing peaks appearing in all chromatograms, which defined our ground truth for the evaluation of the multiple alignments produced by our methods.

In spite of the huge biodiversity in most ecosystems, a model species approach is often taken in environmental studies. To date, we still do not know how many species we need to study to input into models and inform on ecosystem-level responses to change. In this study, we tested current paradigms on factors setting thermal limits by investigating the acute warming response of six Antarctic marine invertebrates: a crustacean Paraceradocus miersi, a brachiopod Liothyrella uva, two bivalve molluscs, Laternula elliptica, Aequiyoldia eightsii, a gastropod mollusc Marseniopsis mollis and an echinoderm Cucumaria georgiana. Each species was warmed at the rate of 1 \u00b0C \/ h and taken to the same physiological end point (just prior to heat coma). Their molecular responses were evaluated using complementary metabolomics (NMR-based metabolomics; LC-MS was also used for one of the sample types) and transcriptomics approaches with the aim of discovering the underlying mechanisms of their resilience or sensitivity to warming. The responses were species-specific; only two showed accumulation of anaerobic end products and three exhibited the classical heat shock response with expression of HSP70 transcripts. These diverse cellular measures did not directly correlate with resilience to heat stress and suggested that each species may have a different critical point of failure. Thus, one unifying molecular mechanism underpinning response to warming could not be assigned, and no overarching paradigm was supported. This biodiversity in response makes future ecosystems predictions extremely challenging, as we clearly need to develop a macrophysiology-type approach to cellular evaluations of the environmental stress response, studying a range of well-rationalized members from different community levels and of different phylogenetic origins rather than extrapolating from one or two arbitrary model species.","Sample collection: The animals were collected at Rothera Research Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctic Peninsula (67o34'07\"S, 68o07'30\"W) during the austral summer at depths of 10-15 m.

The whole aquarium system was held in a controlled temperature room where air temperatures were set at 0.5 - 1.0 \u00b0C. Animals (n=10) were placed in 75 litre internal volume tanks with hollow walls, through which water was pumped from a temperature-controlled unit.

Instead of adding 4 \u00b5l\/mg chloroform directly to the sample in the glass vials, 4 \u00b5l\/mg chloroform and 2 \u00b5l\/mg of double-distilled water were first added to the Precellys tubes and vortexed lightly before adding to the previous homogenate in the glass vials to ensure that all homogenised tissue was carried over for the next step. Both polar and non-polar fractions were removed into separate 1.8 ml glass vials using a Hamilton syringe and stored at -80 \u00b0C before further processing, although only the polar fraction was used for the following analyses. The polar metabolites were then transferred to a 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. Each metabolite sample was dried using a centrifugal concentrator and stored at -80 \u00b0C.","Sample collection: The dried polar extracts were resuspended in sodium phosphate buffer (0.1 M in 10% D2O and 90% H2O, pH 7.0, containing 0.5 mM sodium 3-trimethylsilyl-2,2,3,3,-d4-propionate (TMSP: chemical shift standard).","Nmr spec: The tissue extracts were analysed on the DRX-500 NMR spectrometer (Bruker) equipped with a cryoprobe and operated at 500.18 MHz (at 300 K).","Nmr assay: One-dimensional (1-D) 1H NMR spectra were obtained using excitation sculpting for water suppression and a 8.4 \u03bcs (60 \u00b0) pulse, 6 kHz spectral width and a 3 s relaxation delay with water presaturation. To maximise metabolite discrimination two-dimensional (2-D) 1H J-resolved (JRES) NMR spectra were also acquired for each sample using 8 transients per increment, for 32 increments, which were collected with spectral widths of 6 kHz in F2 (chemical shift axis) and 50 Hz in F1 (spin-spin coupling constant axis). A 4.0 s relaxation delay was employed resulting in a total acquisition time of 24 min.","Chromatography: UHPLC-MS on a 100 mm x 2.1 mm Thermo Hypersil Gold column with a flow rate of 400 \u00b5l\/min: The 15 min programme on the Ultimate 3000 UHPLC system contained a gradient from 100% A (0.1% formic acid in water) to 100% B (0.1% formic acid in methanol).","Mass spec: The LTQ-FT Ultra mass spectrometer acquired data in positive ion mode from m\/z 100-1000 at 50,000 resolution and in centroid mode. To avoid salt contamination, the first 30 s of the LC run were diverted away from the mass spectrometer.","Data transformation: NMR: The JRES spectra were tilted by 45 \u00b0, symmetrised about F1 and calibrated using TopSpin (Bruker Biospin). The data were exported as the 1-D skyline projections of JRES spectra (pJRES) and converted to a format for multivariate analysis using custom-written ProMetab software in MATLAB. The 220 2-D JRES NMR spectra were processed and skyline-projection pJRES spectra were calculated in the Matlab programming environment using NMRlab software. The pJRES spectra were baseline corrected, unwanted spectral regions (containing TMSP, water and a signal between \u03b4H 2.21-2.26) were excluded, spectra were binned to a bin width of 0.005 ppm, normalised and g-log transformed using the lambda parameter 1e-7. LCMS: RPLC-FT-ICR-MS lipidomics data were initially converted into netcdf (.cdf) format using Xcalibur 2.1 and processed using an R based XCMS script to generate an intensity matrix with a list of peak retention times; library(Hmisc) library(xcms) library(CAMERA) xset <- xcmsSet(step=0.01,snthresh=5,mzdiff = 0.001) grp <- group(xset,bw=5,mzwid = 0.001) xsa <- annotate(grp, cor_eic_th=0) peaklist<-getPeaklist(xsa) write.csv(peaklist,'xcms_BAS20131121h.csv') PQN normalisation was carried out using in-house Matlab script, followed by filling missing values in the resulting data matrix using the knn algorithm (k=5). G-log transformation was also using in-house Matlab script.

Two cultivars with different browning susceptibility, fast- browning (FB) and slow-browning (SB) were studied juts after cutting (d0) and after 5 days of storage (d5). Extraction, metabolic profiling, and data-pretreatment procedures were optimized to obtain a robust and reliable data set. Preliminary principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the full dataset (around 8551 extracted, aligned and filtered metabolites) showed a clear separation between the different samples (FB-d0, FB-d5, SB-d0, and SB-d5), highlighting a clear storage time-dependent effect. After statistical analysis applying Student\u00b4s t-test, 536 metabolites were detected as significantly different between d0 and d5 of storage in FB and 633 in SB. Some metabolites (221) were common to both cultivars. Out of these significant compounds, 22 were tentatively identified by matching their molecular formulae with those previously reported in the literature. Five families of metabolites were identified, some of them closely related to quality loss: amino acids, phenolic compounds, sesquiterpene lactones, fatty acids, and lysophospholipids. All compounds showed a clear trend to decrease at d5 except phenolic compounds that increased after storage. Overall, cutting and storage were shown to have a significant impact on the changes of lettuce metabolomics, with different trends depending on the browning susceptibility.","Sample collection: 2 cultivars of iceberg lettuce (Lactuca sativa) with different browning susceptibility after cutting, fast browning (FB) and slow browning (SB), were studied. This divergent evolution of browning during storage was demonstrated in previous studies[1][2]. For the purpose of this study, the names of the cultivars are not mentioned. Iceberg cultivars were grown on autumn in Torre Pacheco (Murcia, Spain). These plantation fields have a loamy clay texture, consisting of 34.4% sand, 32.2% silt and 33.4% clay. Iceberg heads were harvested (10\/12\/2014) 68 days afterplantation, using standard production practices and when the heads reached commercial maturity based on minimum head weight and optimal compactness[3]. Lettuce heads were harvested the day before processing and stored for 24 h at 4 \u00baC and 80% relative humidity. 10 heads per cultivar were processed as independent replicates (5 for d0 and 5 for d5). 4 leaves from the middle part of the head were selected and the midribs were cut into pieces of 1.5 cm. Therefore, each biological replicate consisted of the midribs obtained from 4 leaves of 1 lettuce head. Samples of fresh-cut lettuce were evaluated just after cutting (d0) and after 5 days of storage (d5) at 7 \u00baC. At each time, midribs (30 g FW) of each independent replicate were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \u00baC for less than 1 month. Midribs were freeze-dried and milled to a fine powder using a blender (Oster Professional BPST02-B) with independent jars (Butlers 324Y91, Bormioli). Ref: [1] Martinez-Sanchez, A., Tudela, J.

Freeze dried plant material (0.3 g) was extracted with 10 ml of a mixture of MeOH\/water (80:20). The extraction mixture was sonicated at 30 \u00b0C for 30 min and centrifuged at 10,000 x g for 15 min. The supernatant was reduced to dryness using a speed vacuum concentrator (Savant SPD121P, ThermoScientific, Alcobendas, Spain). The residue was dissolved in 1 ml of the same solution (80% MeOH), centrifuged and filtered through 0.22 \u00b5m PVDF filter (Millipore Millex-GV) before UPLC-ESI-QTOF analysis.

Samples (3 \u00b5l) were injected on a reverse phase Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column (3 x 100 mm, 2.7 \u00b5m) (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany) operating at 30 \u00baC and a flow rate of 0.4 ml\/min. The mobile phases used were acidified water (0.1% formic acid) (Phase A) and acidified ACN (0.1% formic acid) (Phase B). Compounds were separated using the following gradient conditions: 0-10 min, 1-18% phase-B; 10-16 min, 18-38% phase-B; 16-22 min, 38-95% phase-B. Finally, the phase B content was returned to the initial conditions (1%) for 1 min and the column re-equilibrated for 5 more min.","Mass spec: The 6550 Accurate-Mass QTOF MS system was operated in negative ion mode with the mass range set at m\/z 100-1100 in full scan resolution mode. Fragmentor voltage was established at 100 V and acquisition rate at 1.5 spectra\/s. The optimal conditions for the electrospray interface were: gas temperature 280 \u00baC, drying gas 9 l\/min, nebulizer pressure 35 psi, sheath gas temperature 400 \u00baC, sheath gas flow 12 l\/min. As there was no specific group of target analytes (untargeted analysis), generic settings were applied to obtain as many compounds as possible. All samples (20) were injected in the same batch and the order of sample injection was randomized to avoid sample bias. A mixture with 1 replicate of each group of samples was used as 'quality control' (QC) and was injected at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of the batch. Besides, methanol injections were included every 5 samples as a blank run to avoid the carry-over effect. To assure mass accuracy during the MS analysis external calibration of the instrument was performed at the beginning of each batch, introducing a mixture of reference compounds (Tuning Mix). Besides, continuous internal calibration was performed during analyses with the use of signals m\/z 112.9855 and m\/z 1033.9881 in negative polarity.","Data transformation: Total chromatogram raw data obtained from UPLC-QTOF were firstly processed using Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software (version B.06.00 Agilent Technologies). Using the Molecular Feature Extraction (MFE) algorithm a group of ions characterized by retention time, the area of the chromatographic peak, and accurate mass was extracted in each sample as molecular features (MFs). For the extraction procedure minimum absolute abundance was set at 5000 counts, m\/z range was between 100 and 1100 m\/z, charge state 1 and minimum number of ions in the isotopic distribution was considered 2 with a peak spacing tolerance of 0.0025 m\/z plus 7 ppm following the isotope model of 'common organic molecules'. In negative mode adducts [M-H]- and [M-COOH]- were considered in the compounds extraction.

The software lists possible molecular formulae of the compounds on the basis of their exact mass (max error = 5 ppm) and isotopic pattern (total score = 90 considering isotopic distribution, isotopic space, and isotopic abundance). Molecular formulae were generated using an algorithm that combines C (0-60), H (0-120), O, (0-30) N (0-3) and P (0-3).

Despite the importance of such gifts, the molecular composition of the non-gametic components of male ejaculates and their interactions with female reproductive tracts remain poorly understood. During mating, male Photinus fireflies transfer to females a spermatophore gift manufactured by multiple reproductive glands. Here we combined transcriptomics of both male and female reproductive glands with proteomics and metabolomics to better understand the synthesis, composition and fate of the spermatophore in the common Eastern firefly, Photinus pyralis. Our transcriptome of male glands revealed up-regulation of proteases that may enhance male fertilization success and activate female immune response. Using bottom-up proteomics we identified 208 functionally annotated proteins that males transfer to the female in their spermatophore. Targeted metabolomic analysis also provided the first evidence that Photinus nuptial gifts contain lucibufagin, a firefly defensive toxin. The reproductive tracts of female fireflies showed increased gene expression for several proteases that may be involved in egg production. This study offers new insights into the molecular composition of male spermatophores, and extends our understanding of how nuptial gifts may mediate postcopulatory interactions between the sexes.","Sample collection: Photinus pyralis fireflies used in this study were collected at Mercer Meadows Pole Farm, Lawrenceville, NJ (40\u00b018\u201923.4\u201d N, 74\u00b044\u201953.9\u201dW) on 27 June and 11-12 July 2015, and identified based on male genitalia [1] and flash patterns. Both sexes were kept individually in plastic containers with sliced apple and damp paper towel. Mating status of field-collected individuals was unknown.

Early and accurate detection of metabolic changes in the sera of patients with liver cirrhosis can help improve the prognosis of HCC and lead to a better understanding of its mechanism at the molecular level, thus providing patients with in-time treatment of the disease. In this study, we compared metabolite levels in sera of 40 HCC patients and 49 cirrhosis patients from Egypt by using ultraperformance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UPLC-QTOF MS). Following data preprocessing, the most relevant ions in distinguishing HCC cases from cirrhotic controls are selected by statistical methods. Putative metabolite identifications for these ions are obtained through mass-based database search. The identities of some of the putative identifications are verified by comparing their MS\/MS fragmentation patterns and retention times with those from authentic compounds. Finally, the serum samples are reanalyzed for quantitation of selected metabolites as candidate biomarkers of HCC. This quantitation was performed using isotope dilution by selected reaction monitoring (SRM) on a triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqQLIT) coupled to UPLC. Statistical analysis of the UPLC-QTOF data identified 274 monoisotopic ion masses with statistically significant differences in ion intensities between HCC cases and cirrhotic controls. Putative identifications were obtained for 158 ions by mass based search against databases. We verified the identities of selected putative identifications including glycholic acid (GCA), glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA), 3\u03b2, 6\u03b2-dihydroxy-5\u03b2-cholan-24-oic acid, oleoyl carnitine, and Phe-Phe. SRM-based quantitation confirmed significant differences between HCC and cirrhotic controls in metabolite levels of bile acid metabolites, long chain carnitines and small peptide. Our study provides useful insight into appropriate experimental design and computational methods for serum biomarker discovery using LC\u2212MS\/MS based metabolomics. This study has led to the identification of candidate biomarkers with significant changes in metabolite levels between HCC cases and cirrhotic controls. This is the first MS-based metabolic biomarker discovery study on Egyptian subjects that led to the identification of candidate metabolites that discriminate early stage HCC from patients with liver cirrhosis.","Sample collection: After the study protocol has been approved by Tanta University ethical committee, adult patients with HCC or cirrhosis were prospectively recruited from the outpatient clinics and inpatient wards of the Department of Tropical Medicine and Infectious Diseases at Tanta University Hospital, Tanta, Egypt. All participating patients provided informed consent before taking part in the study. Patients were diagnosed to have cirrhosis on the basis of established clinical, laboratory and\/or imaging criteria with ultrasound examination. Cases were suspected to have HCC if they had focal lesion in ultrasound examination and\/or elevated AFP above 200 ng\/ml, but only diagnosed to have HCC based on well-established diagnostic imaging criteria with spiral CT scanning and\/or histopathology examination of liver biopsy. Suspected cases who were not confirmed by CT or biopsy were excluded from both groups of this study. A total of 89 participants were included in this study. The participants consist of 40 HCC cases and 49 patients with liver cirrhosis. Through peripheral venepuncture, single blood sample was drawn into 10 mL BD Vacutainer sterile vacuum tubes without the presence of anticoagulant. The blood was immediately centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min at room temperature. The serum supernatant was carefully collected and centrifuged at 2500 x g for 10 min at room temperature. After aliquoting, serum was kept frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C until use. Primary tubes and serum aliquots were labeled using anonymous confidential code numbers with no personal identifiers. Identification codes were cross-referenced with clinical information in a pass code protected computer system. Samples were transported in dried ice.","Extraction: Frozen human serum was thawed at room temperature and 25 \u03bcl of serum was mixed with 1.5 ml of 66% ACN containing two internal standards (debrisquinone, 1 \u03bcg\/ml, for positive mode and nitrobenzoic acid, 10 \u03bcg\/ml, for negative mode), vortexed and incubated for 10 min on ice. Mixture was then spun at 10 000 x g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Supernatant organic solution was transferred, speed-vacuum-dried at room temperature and reconstituted in 50 \u03bcl of mobile phase (2% ACN containing 0.1% formic acid) ready for injection.","Chromatography: From each sample, 5 \u03bcl was injected onto a reverse-phase 50 \u00d7 2.1 mm ACQUITY 1.7-\u03bcm C18 column (Waters Corp, Milford, MA) using an ACQUITY UPLC system (Waters) with a gradient mobile phase consisting of 2% ACN in water containing 0.1% formic acid (A) and 2% water in ACN containing 0.1% formic acid (B). Each sample was resolved for 10 min at a flow rate of 0.5 ml\/min. The gradient consisted of 100% A for 0.5 min then a ramp of curve 6 to 60% B from 0.5 to 4.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% B from 4.0 to 8.0 min, a hold at 100% B until 9.0 min, then a ramp of curve 6 to 100% A from 9.0 to 9.2 min, followed by a hold at 100% A until 10 min.","Mass spec: The column eluent was introduced directly into the mass spectrometer by electrospray. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on a Q-TOF Premier (Waters) operating in both positive and negative modes. The capillary voltage was set to 3.2 and 3 kV, and the cone voltage of 30 and 20 V, respectively. The desolvation gas flow was set to 800 l\/h and the temperature was set to 350 \u00b0C. The cone gas flow was 25 l\/h, and the source temperature was 120 \u00b0C. Accurate mass was maintained by introduction of LockSpray interface of sulfadimethoxine (311.0814 [M + H]+ or 309.0658 [M \u2212 H]-) at a concentration of 250 pg\/\u03bcl in 50% aqueous ACN and a rate of 150 \u03bcl\/min. UPLC-QTOF data were acquired in centroid mode from 50 to 850 mass-to-charge ratio (m\/z) in MS scanning using the MassLynx software (Waters).","Data transformation: The raw data were converted into Network Common Data Form (NetCDF) format using the MassLynx software (Waters). We used the XCMS package (Scripps Center for Metabolomics, La Jolla, CA) to preprocess each of the eight UPLC-QTOF MS data sets separately. The first step in XCMS is to detect the peaks. The peak detection algorithm first cuts the UPLC-QTOF data into slices, a fraction of a mass unit wide, and then applies a model peak matched filter on those individual slices over the chromatographic time domain. After detecting peaks in individual samples, the peaks are matched across samples to allow calculation of retention time (RT) deviations and relative ion intensity comparison. This is accomplished using a grouping method that uses kernel density estimation to group peaks in the mass domain. These groups are then used to identify and correct drifts in RT from run to run. Following data preprocessing, ion annotation is conducted to identify derivative ions such as isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. This helps group ions that are likely to originate from the same metabolite on the basis of their monoisotopic masses and elution profiles. We used the R-package CAMERA for ion annotation.","Metabolite id: For difference detection, in-house developed MATLAB (Natick, MA) and R scripts are used on the basis of ANOVA statistical models. The ion intensities were first logtransformed to satisfy the normality assumption underlying ANOVA models. On the basis of the experimental design, we took advantage of two-way ANOVA models to combine data sets between batches to increase statistical power. In statistical tests the q-values were estimated based on Storey\u2019s pFDR method. A list of monoisotopic ion masses was obtained for the ions selected by the two-way ANOVA model. Ion annotation information was used to convert the m\/z values of annotated isotopes\/adducts\/neutral-loss fragments ions to the corresponding neutral monoisotopic masses before searching them against the databases. Putative identifications of the monoisotopic masses were found using MetaboSearch to search against four databases: the Human Metabolite DataBase (HMDB), Metlin, Madison Metabolomics Consortium Database (MMCD), and LIPID MAPS. The mass tolerance in MetaboSearch was set to 10 ppm. Identities of some of the putative metabolite identifications were verified by comparing their MS\/MS fragmentation patterns and RT with those of authentic standard compounds. Quantitation of metabolite candidates was performed using isotope dilution technique by UPLC-SRM-MS\/MS analysis on the QTRAP 4000 (AB Sciex) instrument. Because of the high physiochemical similarities between the labeled internal standard and the analyte, degradation during sample preparation, variations in instrumental response, and ion suppression effects in LC\u2212ESI\u2212MS can be compensated. Quantitation of metabolites was achieved by correlating their ratio of MS signals detected by SRM in the calibration curves that we constructed by relating the varying amounts of each analyte to their relative response factors (RRFs) as determined by the ratio of the peak area of the analyte to that of the corresponding isotope-labeled internal standard."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS19","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS19","title":"LC\u2212MS Based Serum Metabolomics for Identification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Biomarkers in Egyptian Cohort","date":"2013-06-30","timestamp":1372546800,"submitter":["Habtom Ressom"],"publications":[{"title":"LC\u2212MS Based Serum Metabolomics for Identification of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Biomarkers in Egyptian Cohort","doi":"10.1021\/pr300673x","pubmed":"PMID:23078175"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"mass spectrometry","platform":"UPLC Q-TOF Premier (Waters)","organism":"Homo sapiens","organism_parts":"blood serum","metabolites":["Fragment of GDCA [\u22122H2O]","Fragment of GDCA [\u2212H2O]","Fragment of GCDCA [\u2212 2H2O]","Fragment of GCDCA [\u2212 H2O]","oleoylcarnitine","[Na+ + GDCA]","Fragment of GCA [\u2212 2H2O]","Fragment of GCA [\u2212 H2O]","glycocholic acid (GCA)","glycodeoxycholic acid (GDCA)","[Na+ + GCDCA]","glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA)","3-guanidinopropionic acid","10-hydroxy-2E,8E-decadiene-4,6-diynoic acid","phenylmethyl methyl ketone","L-N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine","octadecadienal","otadecadienoic acid","oleamide","O-octanoyl-R-carnitine","N-tosyl-L-lysinyl methyl ketone","O-decanoyl-L-carnitine","tetracosahexaenoic acid","palmitylcarnitine","O-linoelaidylcarnitine","PC(O-16:0\/0:0)","LysoPC(20:1)","CerP(d18:1\/12:0)","LysoPC(20:4)","4E,15Z-bilirubin IXa","PE(20:4\/18:1)"]}},"MTBLS147":{"description":["The complex nature of the mechanisms behind cardiovascular diseases prevents the detection of latent early risk conditions.

We adapted methods based on the likelihood of correlation and methods from information theory and combined them with resampling techniques. Our results show that plasma metabolite networks can be defined that associate with latent cardiovascular disease risk.

The samples were obtained after overnight fasting and Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was used as anticoagulant. The presence of EDTA does not affect the quality of the samples: the NMR spectral effects of any interactions between the added EDTA and endogenous components were found to be negligible, thus for plasma samples collected using EDTA as anticoagulant, useful biochemical information can be recovered effectively by metabolomics. The plasma samples for the NMR analysis were obtained from the backup aliquots of samples that, according to the SOPs, are stored in the Transfusion Service for analytical purposes for at least 24 h after blood withdrawal.

High-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) in combination with fragment analysis (MS\/MS) has the potential to contribute to rapid advances in this field. However, the data emerging from such fragmentation spectra pose challenges to downstream analysis, given their complexity and size. Here we apply a molecular networking approach to seek drugs and their metabolites, in fragmentation spectra from urine derived from a cohort of 26 patients on antihypertensive therapy. In total, 165 separate drug metabolites were found and structurally annotated (17 by spectral matching and 122 by classification based on a clustered fragmentation pattern). The clusters could be traced to 13 drugs including the known antihypertensives verapamil, losartan and amlopidine. The molecular networking approach also generated networks of endogenous metabolites, including carnitine derivatives, and conjugates containing glutamine, glutamate and trigonelline. The approach offers unprecedented capability in the untargeted identification of drugs and their metabolites at the population level and has great potential to contribute to understanding stratified responses to drugs where differences in drug metabolism may determine treatment outcome.

In order to perform molecular networking analysis[1][2], the mzXML files were uploaded into the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) environment (http:\/\/gnps.ucsd.edu) a free account is needed to log in) using an FTP server (FileZilla, version 3.10.1.1). Parameter optimization for molecular network generation for the high-resolution mass spectrometry data sets resulted in the following settings. The data was clustered with MS-Cluster with a parent mass tolerance of 0.25 Da and a MS\/MS fragment ion tolerance of 0.005 Da to create consensus spectra. Then, consensus spectra that contained less than 2 spectra were discarded. A network was created where edges were filtered to have a cosine score above 0.55 and 2 or more matched peaks. Further edges between two nodes were kept in the network only if each of the nodes appeared in each other's respective top 10 most similar nodes. The spectra in the network were then searched against the GNPS spectral libraries. The library spectra were filtered in the same manner as the input data. All matches kept between network spectra and library spectra were required to have a cosine score above 0.6 and at least 4 matched peaks. Analog search was enabled against the library with a maximum mass shift of 100.0 Da. All parameters and their values used can be found in Supporting Table S2 in the Supplementary Material of the paper associated with this study. Running times were under 15 min for both combined and single mode fragmentation files. Cytoscape, network visualization software (http:\/\/www.cytoscape.org\/), was then used to further process and visualize the downloaded molecular network data. The recommended graphical layout style is FM3 which is available for Cytoscape versions 2.8.1 and below. Thus, the molecular network was uploaded into Cytoscape (version 2.8.1) following the documentation available on the GNPS website. After applying the FM3 layout plugin, the molecular network was saved in .cys format (Cytoscape Session File) and reopened in Cytoscape version 3.2.0, where labelling and colouring of nodes and edges was conducted. Most importantly, the nodes were labelled with precursor masses, and coloured such that 2 nodes have the same colour when they are present in the same set of files (using the rainbow pallet), and accordingly, 2 nodes having similar colours means that they are present in a similar set of files, often differing in 1 or 2 files). Finally, the size of the nodes was made proportional to the number of unique files from where the node spectra originated, i.e., the larger the node, the more unique files its spectra originated from. The edges were labelled with the mass differences between the two nodes they connect. The resulting molecular networks for the combined and separate fragmentation modes were then inspected in the Cytoscape environment.[1][2] Ref: [1] Yang, J. Y., Sanchez, L. M., Rath, C.

","Metabolite id: Molecular Network inspection: The resulting molecular network was checked by initial library matches to the drugs present in the databases within the GNPS environment. Networks or clusters containing drug annotations were then selected and the individual nodes and edges were inspected, as well as the network topology. This was followed by cluster annotation. Cluster annotation:  Networks or clusters with one or more 'seed nodes' were annotated using the library matching of GNPS as a starting point. Clusters with a topology similar to the seven 'GNPS-annotated drug clusters' were annotated using spectral search in MzCloud of the most MS2 spectrum belonging to the node represented in the most different urine extracts. In addition, MAGMa was used to generate potential candidates if no successful spectral match was found. Endogenous urinary metabolite networks were annotated based on 'seed node annotations' or spectral matching of node spectra to MzCloud. Since the primary aim of this manuscript was to examine drug metabolites in the urine extracts, no further individual annotations on endogenous clusters were conducted. Validation of Molecular Nodes: A node in the molecular network is a set of MS2 spectra each with a cosine similarity score of 0.95 or higher to each other[1]; hence, this means that spectra of several isomers or very related compounds could be combined in one node. If such a situation occurs, the retention time associated with node will become the average RT of the different MS2 spectra associated and as a result will have a relatively large retention time deviation recorded for it. In addition, nodes can represent isotopes, fragments, or adducts of 'real metabolites', as no feature grouping is currently performed during the molecular networking. Thus, the nodes in the cluster need to be validated in the raw data by checking how many metabolites the node represents. Additionally, the most likely elemental formula was assigned and a theoretical mass was determined. Then, based on the validated metabolite spectra, recurring fragments were noted (see Supporting Table 4 of the paper associated with this study) and used to mine the urine extracts by extracted ion chromatograms of those fragment masses. If they co-occurred in the spectrum, the precursor ion mass was checked against the list of already annotated metabolites - and added if it was absent. All drug related networks or clusters prior to validation are presented in the Supporting Information of the paper associated with this study (see Section 2 in Supplementary Materials, Supporting Figures S2 - S15); in the other figures the nodes representing non-drug metabolites (e.g. isotopes or fragments of other nodes) were omitted from the network and colours and labelling were adapted to improve readability. Metabolite Annotation: The drug metabolites were annotated using the library matching, MzCloud database, and by searching for existing drug spectra in Massbank of North America (MoNa, http:\/\/mona.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu). Metabolite annotations are reported according to the Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI) metabolite identification (MI) levels: 1 for unambiguously identified, 2 for a spectral or literature match, 3 for a metabolite classification, 4 for metabolites that can be characterized by a retention time, mass, and fragmentation spectra if available[2]. Thus, if a reliable spectral match was found, the identification level was recorded as 2, if no match was found but a plausible elemental formula, drug specific fragments, and a likely annotation could be assigned, i.e., hydroxylated form of parent drug, the identification level was put to 3. MSI MI level 4 was given to those metabolites where the drug specific mass fragments were present, but no likely elemental formula or annotation could be assigned, or where the recurring fragments could not be assigned to a core structure. All structural information obtained was recorded in Supporting Table S3 in the Supplementary Materials of the paper associated with this study. Ref: [1] Yang, J. Y., Sanchez, L. M., Rath, C.

While evidence suggests microbial community composition partly accounts for differences in coral physiology, how these symbionts affect metabolic pathways remains underexplored. We aimed to assess functional variation between coral-associated microbial partners in hospite. To this end, we characterized and compared microbial community composition and metabolomic profiles from 9 coral species. These data support and expand on previous research by demonstrating microbial communities and metabolite profiles are species-specific and are correlated to one another. Using Porites spp. as a case study, we present evidence that the relative abundance of different sub-clades of Symbiodinium and bacterial\/archaeal families influence the composition of functionally important metabolites. Our data suggests that while some microbial partners benefit the union, others are more opportunistic and possibly parasitize the host. Consequently, coral partner choice likely influences cellular metabolic activities and, therefore, holobiont nutrition.","Sample collection: Coral fragments were collected using bone cutters, hammers and chisels from colonies (n=4-6) of 9 coral species representing 4 genera (Acropora, Montipora, Pocillopora and Porites) from a single fringing reef in Moorea, French Polynesia (S17\u00b028\u201950.914\u201d, W149\u00b048\u201918.639\u201d) in July of 2013. Coral fragments were immediately (< 1 min) immersed into liquid nitrogen to halt coral metabolism following collection.","Extraction: 1 ml of 70% methanol was added for every 0.07 g of lyophilized coral tissue in order to capture a broad range of the metabolome. To enhance extraction efficiency, extracts were sonicated for 15 min and mixed using an orbital shaker for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. The extract was transferred to a storage vial and stored overnight at -80 \u00b0C. To ensure samples were fully extracted, a second solvent volume (1 ml\/0.07 g tissue) was added to the coral nubbin and mixed for another 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. The 2 extraction volumes for each sample were combined and centrifuged (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C) to remove cellular debris and concentrated to dryness using a speed-vacuum.","Sample collection: Extracts were reconstituted in 250 \u00b5l of deuterium oxide (D2O) containing 1 mM 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt (TMSP-d4).

We used a multi-omics systems approach, incorporating proteomics, metabolomics, glycomics, and metagenomics, to explore the molecular interplay between the murine host, the pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), and commensal gut microorganisms during intestinal infection with S. Typhimurium. We find proteomic evidence that S. Typhimurium thrives within the infected 129\/SvJ mouse gut without antibiotic pre-treatment, inducing inflammation and disrupting the intestinal microbiome (e.g., suppressing Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes while promoting growth of Salmonella and Enterococcus). Alteration of the host microbiome population structure was highly correlated with gut environmental changes, including the accumulation of metabolites normally consumed by commensal microbiota. Finally, the less characterized phase of S. Typhimurium's lifecycle was investigated, and both proteomic and glycomic evidence suggests S. Typhimurium may take advantage of increased fucose moieties to metabolize fucose while growing in the gut. The application of multiple omics measurements to Salmonella-induced intestinal inflammation provides insights into complex molecular strategies employed during pathogenesis between host, pathogen, and the microbiome.","Sample collection: 6- to 8-week-old female 129\/SvJ mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME) were used for oral infections. A final inoculum of 1.6 x 10^8 CFU S. Typhimurium\/mouse was delivered by oral gavage to 10 mice (two cages of five mice each = Salmonella-infected). An equal number of mock-infected animals (two cages of five mice each = control) were administered an equal volume of sterile saline. Our infecting dose (10^8 CFU\/mouse) aimed to establish a persistent infection that would ensure observation of S. Typhimurium proteins in downstream analyses. On the day prior to infection, and at seven time points post-infection, mice from one cage were transferred to a clean cage and fecal samples produced at that time were collected, pooled, and immediately frozen at 280 \u00b0C. Samples were collected on days -1, 1, 3, 6, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Frozen fecal samples were thawed on ice, and starting material weight was measured. Samples ranged from four to 25 fecal pellets per pooled sample. After thawing, 150 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer was added to the sample (between 1-2.5 ml based upon starting weight; volumes were recorded and used for downstream normalization), which was subsequently vortexed to disrupt fecal pellets. The resulting slurry was filtered through a 70 mm sieve to separate and remove large debris (mostly undigested food particles). Filtrate was centrifuged (900 x g for 10 min), and the protein-rich pellet thought to contain cellular material was retained as \"P1.\" The supernatant was centrifuged to further clarify the sample (15,000 x g for 10 min). The pellet was retained as \"P2\" and the supernatant retained as \"SN2.\" Preliminary analyses demonstrated that P2 samples contained prohibitively small protein yields; therefore, P2 samples were not investigated further. Proteomic and 16s rDNA sequencing analyses were performed using P1, and metabolite and glycan analyses were performed using SN2.","Extraction: SN2 samples were transferred to 0.6 ml microcentrifuge tubes, and water soluble metabolites were extracted with four volumes of chilled (-20 \u00b0C) chloroform: methanol mixture (2:1). After separating the two phases via centrifugation (12,000 x g, 5 min), the upper aqueous layers were transferred to glass vials and dried under a vacuum concentrator (SpeedVac; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA). All extracted metabolites were subjected to chemical derivatization to enhance their stability and volatility during GC-MS analysis. Methoxyamine in pyridine (30 mg\/ml) was added to each dried sample, and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 90 min to protect carbonyl groups and reduce the number of tautomeric peaks. N-methyl-N- (trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) was then added, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C with shaking for 30 min to transform hydroxyl and amine groups to trimethylsilyated (TMS) forms. The samples were then allowed to cool to room temperature and were analyzed using gas chromatography (GC)-MS.","Chromatography: The GC-MS system used in this study consisted of an Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). GC separations were performed on a HP-5MS column (30 m x 0.25 mm x 0.25 \u00b5m; Agilent Technologies). The injection mode was splitless and 1 ml of each sample was injected; the injection port temperature was held at 250 \u00b0C throughout the analysis. The GC oven was initially maintained at 60 \u00b0C for 1 min and then ramped to 325 \u00b0C by 10 \u00b0C\/min, followed by a 5 min hold at 325 \u00b0C.","Mass spec: An Agilent GC 7890A coupled with a single quadrupole MSD 5975C (Agilent Technologies, Inc.; Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used, and the samples were blocked and analyzed in random order for each experiment. Data were collected over the mass range 50-550 m\/z. A mixture of FAMEs (C8-C28) was analyzed once per day together with the samples for retention index alignment purposes during subsequent data analysis.","Data transformation: GC-MS raw data files from each Experiment were processed using the MetaboliteDetector software, version 2.0.6 beta. Briefly, Agilent.D files were converted to netCDF format using Agilent Chemstation, followed by conversion to binary files using Metabolite Detector. Retention indices of detected metabolites were calculated based on the analysis of the FAMEs mixture, followed by their chromatographic alignment across all analyses after deconvolution.","Metabolite id: Metabolites were initially identified by matching experimental spectra to an augmented version of FiehnLib (i.e., the Agilent Fiehn Metabolomics Retention Time Locked (RTL) Library, containing spectra and validated retention indices for over 700 metabolites), using a Metabolite Detector match probability threshold of 0.6 (combined retention index and spectral probability). All metabolite identifications were manually validated to reduce deconvolution errors during automated data-processing and to eliminate false identifications. The NIST 08 GC-MS library was also used to cross validate the spectral matching scores obtained using the Agilent library and to provide identifications of unmatched metabolites. Fragment ions due to trimethylsilylation (i.e. m\/z 73 and 147) were excluded from the determination of metabolite abundance.

The confinement of HBV replication to the liver, which also acts as the central hub for metabolic and nutritional regulation, emphasizes the interlinked nature of host metabolism and the disease. Still, the metabolic processes operational during the distinct clinical phases of a chronic HBV infection\u2014immune tolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases\u2014remains unexplored. <\/p> Methods: To investigate this, we conducted a targeted metabolomics approach on serum to determine the metabolic progression over the clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, using patient samples grouped based on their HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and HBeAg serum levels. <\/p> Results: Our data illustrate the strength of metabolomics to provide insight into the metabolic dysregulation experienced during chronic HBV. The immune tolerant phase is characterized by the speculated viral hijacking of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle, explaining the reduced glycerophospholipid and increased plasmalogen species, indicating a strong link to HBV replication. The persisting impairment of the choline glycerophospholipids, even during the inactive carrier phase with minimal HBV activity, alludes to possible metabolic imprinting effects. The progression of chronic HBV is associated with increased concentrations of very long chain triglycerides together with citrulline and ornithine, reflective of a dysregulated urea cycle peaking in the HBV envelope antigen-negative phase. <\/p> Conclusions: The work presented here will aid in future studies to (i) validate and understand the implication of these metabolic changes using a thorough systems biology approach, (ii) monitor and predict disease severity, as well as (iii) determine the therapeutic value of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle. <\/p> The Oxylipin assay and the Biogenic amine and Acyl-carnitine assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights studies MTBLS253 and MTBLS280 respectively.","Sample collection: Study population: 69 chronic HBV patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this discovery study.

Patients were treatment na\u00efve and excluded if they had other chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus) or a body mass index of 31 or more. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The ethical review board of the Erasmus MC approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients who were asked to donate blood. Definition of chronic HBV clinical phases: Serum ALT was measured on an automated analyzer, qualitative serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and anti-HBeAg antibodies (Abs) were measured on an Architect Abbott analyzer, and serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS AmpliPrep-COBAS Taq- Man HBVv2test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Based on serum HBV DNA, ALT levels and HBeAg presence at the time of sampling, patients were categorized into four clinical HBV phases according to international guidelines[1].

The confinement of HBV replication to the liver, which also acts as the central hub for metabolic and nutritional regulation, emphasizes the interlinked nature of host metabolism and the disease. Still, the metabolic processes operational during the distinct clinical phases of a chronic HBV infection\u2014immune tolerant, immune active, inactive carrier, and HBeAg-negative hepatitis phases\u2014remains unexplored. <\/p> Methods: To investigate this, we conducted a targeted metabolomics approach on serum to determine the metabolic progression over the clinical phases of chronic HBV infection, using patient samples grouped based on their HBV DNA, alanine aminotransferase, and HBeAg serum levels. <\/p> Results: Our data illustrate the strength of metabolomics to provide insight into the metabolic dysregulation experienced during chronic HBV. The immune tolerant phase is characterized by the speculated viral hijacking of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle, explaining the reduced glycerophospholipid and increased plasmalogen species, indicating a strong link to HBV replication. The persisting impairment of the choline glycerophospholipids, even during the inactive carrier phase with minimal HBV activity, alludes to possible metabolic imprinting effects. The progression of chronic HBV is associated with increased concentrations of very long chain triglycerides together with citrulline and ornithine, reflective of a dysregulated urea cycle peaking in the HBV envelope antigen-negative phase. <\/p> Conclusions: The work presented here will aid in future studies to (i) validate and understand the implication of these metabolic changes using a thorough systems biology approach, (ii) monitor and predict disease severity, as well as (iii) determine the therapeutic value of the glycerol-3-phosphate\u2013NADH shuttle. <\/p> The Oxylipin assay and the Lipid assays for this study can be found in the MetaboLights studies MTBLS253 and MTBLS279 respectively.","Sample collection: Study population: 69 chronic HBV patients and 19 healthy controls (HCs) were included in this discovery study. Blood was prospectively collected in SST tubes at the Erasmus MC and centrifuged to separate the serum and stored at -80 \u00b0C until analysis. Patients were treatment na\u00efve and excluded if they had other chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis C virus) or a body mass index of 31 or more. This study was conducted in accordance with the guidelines of the Declaration of Helsinki and the principles of Good Clinical Practice. The ethical review board of the Erasmus MC approved the study and informed consent was obtained from all patients who were asked to donate blood. Definition of chronic HBV clinical phases: Serum ALT was measured on an automated analyzer, qualitative serum HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBeAg, and anti-HBeAg antibodies (Abs) were measured on an Architect Abbott analyzer, and serum HBV DNA levels were measured using the COBAS AmpliPrep-COBAS Taq- Man HBVv2test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Systems, Indianapolis, IN). Based on serum HBV DNA, ALT levels and HBeAg presence at the time of sampling, patients were categorized into four clinical HBV phases according to international guidelines[1]. Immune tolerant (IT, n=18) patients had detectable serum HBeAg and repetitive normal ALT values (<40 U\/l). The HBeAg-positive immune active (IA, n=12) and HBeAg-negative (ENEG, n=19) patients had repetitive or intermittent abnormal serum ALT (>40 U\/l) values, and HBV DNA levels >2,000 IU\/ml. Inactive carrier (IC, n=20) patients were HBeAg-negative and had both repetitive normal ALT values (<40 IU\/l) and HBV DNAllevels below 20,000 IU\/ml. Note: A Unit (U)\/litre(l) (SI unit) is equivalent to an International (IU)\/litre(l) (US unit)[2] Quality control samples: Quality control (QC) samples consisted of equally pooled volumes of all study samples. A set of QC samples was then included during the analyses of the experimental groups on the individual metabolomic platforms and evenly distributed through the randomized samples prior to liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) analyses. In addition, independent duplicate samples (10\u201315%) were randomly selected where sample volume allowed.

Then proteins are precipitated by the addition of methanol. The supernatant was transferred to a new eppendorf tube and dried under vacuum.

Metabolomic profiling can describe the response of individuals to disturbance (i.e., shifts in environmental conditions) across biological models and is a powerful approach for characterizing and comparing coral metabolism. For the first time, we assess the utility of a proton-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-NMR)-based metabolomics approach in characterizing coral metabolite profiles by 1) investigating technical, intra-, and inter-sample variation, 2) evaluating the ability to recover targeted metabolite spikes, and 3) assessing the potential for this method to differentiate among coral species. Our results indicate 1H-NMR profiling of Porites compressa corals is highly reproducible and exhibits low levels of variability within and among colonies. The spiking experiments validate the sensitivity of our methods and showcase the capacity of orthogonal partial least squares discriminate analysis (OPLS-DA) to distinguish between profiles spiked with varying metabolite concentrations (0 mM, 0.1 mM, and 10 mM). Finally, 1H-NMR metabolomics coupled with OPLS-DA, revealed species-specific patterns in metabolite profiles among four reef-building corals (Pocillopora damicornis, Porites lobata, Montipora aequituberculata, and Seriatopora hystrix). Collectively, these data indicate that 1H-NMR metabolomic techniques can profile reef-building coral metabolomes and have the potential to provide an integrated picture of the coral phenotype in response to environmental change.","Sample collection: Technical, Intra-, and Inter-Colony Variability Reef-building coral samples were collected from a small area (ca. 135 m2) of a fringing reef in Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii (21\u00b025'58.28\"N, 157\u00b047'23.55\"W) using bone cutters and immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen. Samples used to assess intra-colony and technical variation in metabolite profiles were collected in December 2011, while those used to assess inter-colony variability were sampled in June 2013. While coral metabolite content may change, variability measured in 1H-NMR profiles is still likely to be comparable within and among colonies through time. Following sample collection, coral fragments were lyophilized and stored at -80 \u00b0C prior to metabolite extraction. To assess technical variation, three replicate fragments from separate colonies were collected, pooled, and pulverized. From these samples, 5 replicate extractions were performed. Five fragments of a single Porites compressa colony, which is a dominant reef-building coral in Hawaii, and 5 from separate colonies were used to assess intra- and inter-colony variation in 1H-NMR profiles. Spiking Experiment Eighteen fragments from a P. compressa colony were collected from a small region (c.a. 135 m2) of a fringing reef adjacent to HIMB in December 2011. Species Comparison Replicate fragments (n = 8\u20139) of Montipora aequituberculata, Pocillopora damicornis, Porites lobata, and Seriatopora hystrix were collected from Nanwan Bay, Taiwan (ca. 21\u00b056'31\"N, 120\u00b044'56\"E) in the June of 2011 and transported to the National Museum for Marine Biology and Aquarium (NMMBA), Checheng, Taiwan. These coral species are dominant reef-building corals in Taiwan and represent ecologically distinct taxa with varying morphological and physiological characteristics. Corals were re-fragmented and allowed to recover in a flow-through holding tank (environmental conditions: Temperature 27.6\u00b10.03 \u00b0C; Salinity 33.8\u00b10.02 ppt; Light 107\u00b13.85 \u00b5mol photon) for two weeks prior to sampling for metabolome analysis.","Extraction: Technical, Intra-, and Inter-Colony Variability All Porites compressa samples were extracted following extraction method 1. Only inter-colony samples were re-extracted using method 2 to determine if variation in metabolite profiles differed between protocols used in the current study. - Extraction Method 1:<br>1 ml of pre-cooled 70% methanol\/water (v\/v; 70% MeOH) was added for every 0.7 g of coral to assess technical, intra-, and inter-colony variability. All extracts were sonicated for 15 min and shaken for 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. To ensure samples were fully extracted, a second solvent volume was added to each coral fragment for an additional 24 h at 4 \u00b0C. The two resulting extracts were combined and cellular debris removed by centrifugation (4000 rpm for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C). The supernatant containing the extracted metabolites was removed from the pellet and concentrated using a speed-vacuum concentrator. Extract weights were obtained prior to data acquisition and used to normalize 1H-NMR spectra. - Extraction method 2: Five inter-colony samples were also extracted by adding 2 ml of 70% MeOH (v\/v) for every 0.1 g of coral. Extracts were sonicated for 15 min, mixed on ice for 45 min, and concentrated using a combination of rotary evaporation and lyophilization. Extract weights were obtained prior to data acquisition and used to normalize between 1H-NMR spectra. Spiking Experiment Fragment volumes were assessed by displacement of deionized (DI) water, which was used to remove excess salt and to determine the amount of solvent to add to each nubbin during metabolite extraction. While the addition of DI water may activate enzymatic pathways resulting in changes in metabolite composition, the identical treatment across all samples allows for comparison of coral metabolomes. Subsequently, fragments were immersed in liquid nitrogen to halt metabolism. To evaluate the capacity of 1H-NMR methods to identify differences in concentrations of coral metabolites, 1 M alanine, 1 M glycolic acid, and 1 M glucose were combined and diluted with DI water to prepare 0.1 mM and 10 mM metabolite cocktail spikes. Directly prior to metabolite extraction, 10 \u00b5l of the treatment and control (DI water only) cocktails were added to the surface of each whole coral nubbin (n = 6\/treatment). Five ml of 70% methanol was added to each fragment for every 1 ml of coral volume (v\/v) and metabolites were extracted following method 2 described above. Species Comparison Corals were briefly rinsed with DI water to remove excess salts, immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, pulverized and transported on dry ice back to the HIMB where they were stored at -80 \u00b0C. Metabolites were extracted following extraction method 2 described above.","Sample collection: Coral extracts were reconstituted in 250 \u00b5l of deuterium oxide (D2O) containing 1 mM of 3-(trimethylsilyl)propionic acid sodium salt (TMSP-d4) to facilitate comparison of resulting profiles to metabolites in 1H-NMR databases. Extracts were briefly sonicated and transferred to a 3 mm NMR tube.","Nmr spec: 1H-NMR profiles were obtained using a 500 MHz Varian Unity Inova spectrometer equipped with a 1H\/x-broadband 3 mm probe.","Nmr assay: Spectra were acquired using a water suppression pulse sequence (PRESAT), consisting of 128 (extraction method 1) or 64 (extraction method 2) transients of 32 K data-points with a relaxation delay of 1 s (extraction method 1) or 3 s (extraction method 2) over a spectral window of 5500 Hz. Resulting spectra were zero-filled to 64 K and multiplied by a line-broadening factor of 0.5 Hz prior to Fourier transformation.","Data transformation: Spectra were imported in to MestreNova (Mestrelabs version 7.1.2), where spectral baselines were adjusted using Whittiker smoothing and normalized to the total area. Three alignments were created to compare 1H-NMR (1) profile variability, (2) spectra spiked with the metabolite cocktails, and (3) fingerprints among coral species. All alignments were reduced to ASCII files. Variables corresponding to the residual water impurity (4.48\u20134.92 ppm) and an observed acetone contaminant (2.22\u20132.27 ppm) were removed. Alignments were imported into Metabolink (http:\/\/metabolink.knoesis.org), where a dynamic adaptive binning routine was used to identify each peak as a separate variable. For each alignment, bins were found between 0.5 to 10 ppm. R statistical environment (version 3.0.0, R Development Core Team 2013, http:\/\/www.R-project.org) was used for all further analysis, including normalizing spectral intensities to extract weights for comparison across samples.","Metabolite id: To determine which variables drive separation in metabolite composition among coral species, variable coefficients from the OPLS-DA model were compared to their null distributions. Null distributions were calculated by refitting the OPLS-DA model to the data, in which each variable is independently and randomly permuted to remove correlation structure. The actual coefficients were compared to their null distributions and variables in the tails (a = 0.01) were determined to significantly contribute to the model. To facilitate identification of the metabolites driving separation between species, a statistical total correlation spectroscopy analysis (STOSCY) in the R package MUMA was used to determine strong correlations between 1H-NMR variables. Highly correlated variables (r2>0.9) were assumed to originate from the same compound. Metabolites were assigned by matching peak positions and patterns to Chenomx 500 MHz spectral libraries. Data analysis: To investigate variability in 1H-NMR spectra, relative standard deviations were calculated across variables for each group. A Kruskal-Wallis analysis was applied to compare values among technical, intra-, and inter-colony spectra from Porites compressa. In the spiking experiment, Chenomx NMR Suite 7.6 (Chenomx, Inc., Edmonton, Alberta, Canada) was used to identify and quantify 1H-NMR signals resulting from the metabolite spikes. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to statistically compared metabolite concentrations of alanine, glucose, and glycolic acid among treatment groups. All variables from the three alignments were scaled to unity and mean centered prior to multivariate analysis. Both principal component analysis (PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate analyses (OPLS-DA) were used to investigate patterns in variables arising from 1H-NMR spectra. PCA was applied to investigate patterns between 1H-NMR profiles. Additionally, PCA was used to screen for outlying samples. If spectra fell outside a 99% confidence interval and upon further inspection it was determined that NMR shims influenced resulting peak shapes and line widths, spectra were excluded from subsequently analyses. OPLS-DA was applied to discriminate between 1H-NMR profiles arising from (1) spiking treatments and (2) among coral species (for source code see http:\/\/birg.cs.cofc.edu\/index.php\/O-PLS). Model strength was assessed using both R2 and Q2 metrics. R2 values report the total amount of variance explained by the model in both the 1H-NMR data (R2X) and independent variables (R2Y; e.g. spiking treatment or species identity). Q2 reports model accuracy and is calculated by 10-fold cross validation. The resulting Q2 statistic was compared to a null distribution to test model significance (p<0.05). When there are more than three groups, the resulting model is influenced by group order. To facilitate comparing metabolite fingerprints among spiking treatments and reef-building corals, we developed an iterative strategy based on the magnitude of Q2 to determine group ordering in the model. The algorithm finds the maximum Q2 value between the two groups with the largest separation along the t-axis. Additional groups are inserted into the model based on the magnitude of Q2. The overall Q2 value is determined from model projections after allowing groups to cluster together based on profile similarities. Finally, the OPLS-DA algorithm calculates coefficients describing the contribution of each variable to the model."],"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/dataset.jsonld","accession":"MTBLS116","url":"http:\/\/www.ebi.ac.uk\/metabolights\/MTBLS116","title":"Application of 1H-NMR Metabolomic Profiling for Reef-Building Corals.","date":"2014-11-20","timestamp":1416441600,"submitter":["Emilia Sogin"],"publications":[{"title":"1H-NMR Metabolomics for Reef-Building Corals","doi":"10.1371\/journal.pone.0111274","pubmed":"PMID:25354140"}],"meta":{"@context":"http:\/\/feeds.metabolomexchange.org\/contexts\/metadata.jsonld","analysis":"NMR spectroscopy","platform":"Agilent","organism":["Pocillopora damicornis","Porites lobata","Porites compressa","Seriatopora hystrix","Montipora aequituberculata"],"organism_parts":"endometabolome","metabolites":["Unknown 1 (Branch-chained amino acids)","Unknown 2 (Branch-chained amino acids)","Unknown 3 ((Aliphatic))","Threonine\/Lactate (Organic Acid)","Unknown 4 (Lipid)","Alanine","Unknown 5 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 6 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 7 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 8 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 9 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 10 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 11 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 12 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 13 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 14 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 15 (Aliphatic)","Unknown 16 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 17 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 18 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 19 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 20 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 21 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 22 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 23 (Carbohydrates)","Unknown 24 (Carbohydrates)","Trigonelline","alanine","glucose","glycolate"]}}},"shortname":"mtbls"}
