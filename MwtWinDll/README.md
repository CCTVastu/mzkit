An algorithm for filtering molecular formulas is derived from seven heuristic rules: 

+ ``(1)`` restrictions for the number of elements, 
+ ``(2)`` LEWIS and SENIOR chemical rules, 
+ ``(3)`` isotopic patterns, 
+ ``(4)`` hydrogen/carbon ratios, 
+ ``(5)`` element ratio of nitrogen, oxygen, phosphor, and sulphur versus carbon, 
+ ``(6)`` element ratio probabilities and 
+ ``(7)`` presence of trimethylsilylated compounds.

### Rule #1 â€“ restrictions for element numbers

For developing this rule, the absolute element limits were calculated by simply dividing the mass range through the element mass (e.g. for ``carbon = 12 Da`` at 1000 Da follows ``1000/12 = 83``) maximum limit for a hypothetical molecule that consists exclusively of carbon.
